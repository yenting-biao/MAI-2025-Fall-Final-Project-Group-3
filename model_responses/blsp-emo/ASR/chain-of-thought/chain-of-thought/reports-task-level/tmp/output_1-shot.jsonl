No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required.

The audio is identified as containing the sequence: /wɒn/ (when) - /bɑːrθlɪ/ (bartley) - /əˈraɪvd/ (arrived) - /æt/ (at) - /bedfərd/ (bedford) - /ˈsquaɪər/ (square) - /ˈsʌndə/ (sunday) - /ˈeɪvɪŋ/ (evening) - /ˈmɑːri/ (marie) - /ˈpɪtɪ/ (pretty) - /ˈlɪtəl/ (little) - /frɛnʃ/ (french) - /gɜːl/ (girl) - /mɛt/ (met) - /hɪm/ (him) - /æt/ (at) - /ðə/ (the) - /dɔːr/ (door) - /ænd/ (and) - /kənˈdʌktɪd/ (conducted) - /hɪm/ (him) - /ʌpˈstæriːz/ (upstairs).\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each group of phonemes is matched against an extensive vocabulary model to identify the most probable words.\n    *   The sound /wɒn/ is recognized as the adverb \"when\".\n    *   The sound /bɑːrθlɪ/ is recognized as the proper noun \"bartley\".\n    *   The sound /əˈraɪvd/ is identified as the verb \"arrived\".\n    *   The sound /æt/ is identified as the preposition \"at\".\n    *   The sound /bedfərd/ is recognized as the proper noun \"bedford\".\n    *   The sound /ˈsquaɪər/ is recognized as the noun \"square\".\n    *   The sound /ˈsʌndə/ is identified as the noun \"sunday\".\n    *   The sound /ˈeɪvɪŋ/ is identified as the noun \"evening\".\n    *   The sound /ˈmɑːri/ is recognized as the proper noun \"marie\".\n    *   The sound /ˈpɪtɪ/ is recognized as the adjective \"pretty\".\n    *   The sound /ˈlɪtəl/ is recognized as the adjective \"little\".\n    *   The sound /frɛnʃ/ is recognized as the adjective \"french\".\n    *   The sound /gɜːl/ is recognized as the noun \"girl\".\n    *   The sound /mɛt/ is recognized as the verb \"met\".\n    *   The sound /hɪm/ is recognized as the pronoun \"him\".\n    *   The sound /æt/ is identified as the preposition \"at\".\n    *   The sound /ðə/ is recognized as the article \"the\".\n    *   The sound /dɔːr/ is recognized as the noun \"door\".\n    *   The sound /ænd/ is recognized as the conjunction \"and\".\n    *   The sound /kənˈdʌktɪd/ is recognized as the verb \"conducted\".\n    *   The sound /hɪm/ is recognized as the pronoun \"him\".\n    *   The sound /ʌpˈstæriːz/ is recognized as the noun \"upstairs\".\n4.  **Sentence Construction:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken. The resulting sequence, \"When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs,\" is checked for grammatical correctness, confirming it forms a coherent and valid sentence.\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, standard punctuation is applied. The first word is capitalized, and a period is added at the end to signify a complete declarative sentence.\n\nThe final written text is: \"When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the final quoted sentence as the ASR transcription and removed all preceding reasoning and meta-comments. I will output only that continuous substring exactly as it appears in the model response.\n\nResult: When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs."}

The waveform shows a single, continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. I identify the sequence of sounds as they are spoken:\n    *   \"he\" (/hɪ/)\n    *   \"could\" (/kʊd/)\n    *   \"hardly\" (/hɑːdlɪ/)\n    *   \"stand\" (/stænd/)\n    *   \"still\" (/stɪl/)\n    *   \"so\" (/səʊ/)\n    *   \"great\" (/ɡreɪt/)\n    *   \"was\" (/wɒz/)\n    *   \"his\" (/hɪz/)\n    *   \"mental\" (/ˈmentəl/)\n    *   \"agitation\" (/ˌæɡɪˈteɪʃən/)\n    *   \"and\" (/ænd/)\n    *   \"he\" (/hɪ/)\n    *   \"ran\" (/ræn/)\n    *   \"towards\" (/əˈraʊdz/)\n    *   \"homes\" (/həʊmz/)\n    *   \"with\" (/wɪð/)\n    *   \"two\" (/tuː/)\n    *   \"eager\" (/ˈɪɡər/)\n    *   \"hands\" (/hændz/)\n    *   \"outstretched\" (/ˌaʊtˈstretʃɪst/)\n    *   \"thank\" (/θæŋk/)\n    *   \"heaven\" (/ˈheɪvən/)\n    *   \"that\" (/ðæt/)\n    *   \"you\" (/juː/)\n    *   \"have\" (/hæv/)\n    *   \"come\" (/kʌm/)\n\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words.\n    *   The sounds /ɡreɪt/ and /æɡɪˈteɪʃən/ are recognized as \"great\" and \"agitation,\" respectively, due to the context provided by the next word.\n    *   The word \"thank\" is identified as \"thank\" due to its common usage and the context provided by the next word.\n    *   The word \"heaven\" is recognized as \"heaven\" due to its common usage and the context provided by the next word.\n    *   The word \"you\" is identified as \"you\" due to its common usage and the context provided by the next word.\n    *   The word \"have\" is identified as \"have\" due to its common usage and the context provided by the next word.\n    *   The word \"come\" is identified as \"come\" due to its common usage and the context provided by the next word.\n\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly and Finalization:** The recognized words are assembled into a coherent sentence. A language model evaluates the sequence \"He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the final transcribed sentence provided by the model and removed all explanatory and meta content surrounding it; I copied the sentence exactly as it appears in the response.\n\nResult: \"He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come.\""}
