**question** and a **model's response**. The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\nApproach this problem by breaking it into small steps.\n**Model's Response**: [ANS] **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio file is analyzed to identify the key acoustic features. It contains a single human voice, which sounds clear and expressive. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\n    *   The first sound cluster /wɛ/ is identified as the word \"we.\"\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /ʃʊt/ + /ɔr/ + /ˈeɪz/ + /ðə/ + /ˈfɔːləz/ + /bəʊm/ + /ɒn/ + /wɛ/ + /ˈmɜːrər/ + /bʌt/ + /ˈkɔːnərz/ +

A final review of the audio confirms that this transcription accurately captures the spoken words and their intended meaning.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"I was bit keeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the final quoted sentence in the model's response as the ASR transcription and removed the preceding explanatory text.

The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\nGo through the question logically, then answer it.\n**Model's Response**: [ANS] The transcribed text is:\n\nUnfortunately, the fracture could not be set until six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time, and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.\n\nThis text is a direct transcription of the spoken statement, preserving the original meaning and context. The sentence structure and grammar are also accurate, reflecting the natural flow of the spoken language.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the ASR transcription as the sentence following \"[ANS] The transcribed text is:\" and removed the model's explanatory sentences. The Result line contains that exact continuous substring copied verbatim from the response.\n\nResult: Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set until six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time, and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state."}

The waveform shows a single, continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. I identify the sequence of sounds as they are spoken:\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"think\\\" (/θɪŋk/)\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"have\\\" (/hæv/)\\n    *   \\\"a\\\" (/ə/)\\n    *   \\\"doctor's\\\" (/ˈdɑktərz/)\\n    *   \\\"appointment\\\" (/əˈpɔɪntmənt/)\\n\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sounds /dɑktərz/ are distinctly recognized as the possessive \\\"doctor's,\\\" not the plural \\\"doctors,\\\" due to the context provided by the next word.\\n    *   The two-syllable word /əˈpɔɪntmənt/ is clearly identified as \\\"appointment.\\\"\\n\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly and Finalization:** The recognized words are assembled into a coherent sentence.
