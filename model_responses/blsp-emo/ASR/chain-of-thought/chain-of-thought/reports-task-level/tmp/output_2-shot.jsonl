The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken phrases into written words.\nExplain the process in simple, logical steps.\n**Model's Response**: **Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The process starts by receiving and analyzing the digital audio waveform. I identify a single, clear voice speaking a complete sentence at a conversational pace.\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The continuous audio stream is broken down into its core sound units, or phonemes. The recognized sequence is approximately: /ˈsʌm.təm/ /haʊd/ /wʌndər/ /ɒn/ /ˈfɔːt/ /ʌpən/ /ðə/ /ˈsændi/ /hɔːr/ /ənd/ /ˈsaʊtəm/ /haʊd/ /ˈriːd/ /əlɔːt/ /əlˈtwʌntɪ/ /bi/ /ˈtaɪs/ /tə/ /briːn/ /tə/ /ðɪs/ /ˈtaɪs/ /tə/ /briːn/ /tə/ /ˈend/ /ɪn/ /ˈhʌriː/.\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\n    *   /ˈsʌm.təm/ corresponds to \"sometimes\".\n    *   /haʊd/ matches with \"he would\".\n    *   /wʌndər/ is recognized as \"wander\".\n    *   /ɒn/ is identified as \"on\".\n    *   /ˈfɔːt/ /ʌpən/ /ðə/ /ˈsændi/ /hɔːr/ /ənd/ /ˈsaʊtəm/ /haʊd/ /ˈriːd/ /əlɔːt/ /əlˈtwʌntɪ/ /bi/ /ˈtaɪs/ /tə/ /briːn/ /tə/ /ðɪs/ /ˈtaɪs/ /tə/ /briːn/ /tə/ /ˈend/ /ɪn/ /ˈhʌriː/.\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order. The sentence structure is: \"Sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end.\"\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, standard punctuation is applied. The first word is capitalized, and a period is added at the end to signify a complete declarative sentence. The final written text is: \"Sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the final written sentence presented as the transcription and removed preceding explanations, phonetic details, and meta-comments. I copied the exact continuous substring from the model's response that is the ASR output.\n\nResult: \"Sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end.\""}

The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\nApproach this problem by breaking it into small steps.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio file is analyzed to identify the key acoustic features. It contains a single human voice, which sounds clear and expressive. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\n    *   The first sound cluster /wɛ/ is identified as the word \"we.\"\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /ʃʊt/ + /ɔːr/ + /ˈeɪz/ + /ðə/ + /fɔːləz/ + /bəʊm/ + /ɒn/ + /wɛ/ + /ɪz/ + /ˈmɜːrər/ + /bʌt/ +

The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**.

No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken sentence into written words.\nStart with an analysis, then provide the correct response.\n**Model's Response**: **Thought Process:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio file contains a single, continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.
