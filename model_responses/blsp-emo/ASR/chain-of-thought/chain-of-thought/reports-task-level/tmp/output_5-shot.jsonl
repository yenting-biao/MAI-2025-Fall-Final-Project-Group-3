The waveform shows a single, continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. I identify the sequence of sounds as they are spoken:\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"think\\\" (/θɪŋk/)\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"have\\\" (/hæv/)\\n    *   \\\"a\\\" (/ə/)\\n    *   \\\"doctor's\\\" (/ˈdɑktərz/)\\n    *   \\\"appointment\\\" (/əˈpɔɪntmənt/)\\n\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sounds /dɑktərz/ are distinctly recognized as the possessive \\\"doctor's,\\\" not the plural \\\"doctors,\\\" due to the context provided by the next word.\\n    *   The two-syllable word /əˈpɔɪntmənt/ is clearly identified as \\\"appointment.\\\"\\n\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly and Finalization:** The recognized words are assembled into a coherent sentence. A language model evaluates the sequence \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment\\\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment.\\\"<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nWrite the spoken material from the provided clip in text form.\\nOutline your thinking path clearly from start to finish.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 4]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Thinking Path:**\\n\\n1.  **Initial Audio Reception:** The first step is to process the audio file. I listen to the clip to get a general sense of the content, identifying a single human voice speaking a complete sentence. The audio is clear with minimal background noise.\\n2.  **Word-by-Word Segmentation:** I then break down the continuous speech into individual, recognizable words.

This forms a grammatically correct and coherent sentence.\\n4.  **Final Verification:** I perform a final check by re-playing the audio while simultaneously reviewing the constructed sentence: \\\"I wonder what this is about.\\\" The transcription perfectly matches the spoken words, cadence, and intonation of the audio clip, confirming its accuracy.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nGenerate the textual representation of the provided spoken input.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 5]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Reasoning Steps:**\\n\\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The process starts by receiving the audio file and analyzing its sound wave characteristics, such as frequency, amplitude, and timing.\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its smallest distinct units of sound, called phonemes. The audio is identified as containing the sequence: /ðə/ (The) - /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ (surface) - /ɪz/ (is) - /slɪk/ (slick).\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each group of phonemes is matched against an extensive vocabulary model to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sound /ðə/ is recognized as the article \\\"The\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ are matched to the noun \\\"surface\\\".\\n    *   The sound /ɪz/ is identified as the verb \\\"is\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /slɪk/ are recognized as the adjective \\\"slick\\\".\\n4.  **Sentence Construction:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken. The resulting sequence, \\\"The surface is slick,\\\" is checked for grammatical correctness, confirming it forms a coherent and valid sentence.\\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, standard punctuation is applied. The first word is capitalized, and a period is added at the end to signify a complete declarative sentence.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"The surface is slick.\\\"<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nConvert the provided speech into written text.\\nSolve this problem one step at a time.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 6]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\"", "response": "**Thought Process:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio file is received and analyzed to identify the speaker's voice, the content, and the clarity of the speech.\n2.  **Word-by-Word Segmentation:** The continuous speech is broken down into individual, recognizable words.

The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required.

The first word is capitalized, and a period is added at the end to signify a complete declarative sentence.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"The surface is slick.\\\"<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nPut the words from the provided voice recording into text.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 3]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to transcribe the audio file:\\n\\n1.  The audio file is analyzed to identify the spoken words. The recording contains a single male speaker with clear enunciation.\\n2.  The first phrase spoken is identified by listening to the beginning of the recording. The words are transcribed as \\\"I would like\\\".\\n3.  Continuing the transcription, the next sequence of words is identified as \\\"a new alarm\\\".\\n4.  The final word in the recording is isolated and transcribed as \\\"clock\\\".\\n5.

It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a short, clear sentence. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\\n    *   The first sound cluster /ɪts/ is clearly identified as the common contraction \\\"It's\\\".\\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /əˈlɛvən/, is recognized as the word \\\"eleven\\\". The stress pattern on the second syllable is a key identifier.\\n    *   The final sound cluster, /əˈklɒk/, is a distinct and standard pronunciation for the term \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Assembly:** The identified words are then sequenced in the order they were spoken: \\\"It's\\\" + \\\"eleven\\\" + \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n4.  **Contextual Verification:** The resulting phrase, \\\"It's eleven o'clock,\\\" is a grammatically correct and common expression used to state the time. This logical and contextual consistency confirms the accuracy of the transcription.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nTurn the provided verbal audio into a text version.\\nDevelop your explanation in consecutive logical steps.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 5]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The process begins by receiving and analyzing the digital audio waveform.

The recognized sequence is approximately: /meɪbi/ /təmɑroʊ/ /ɪt/ /wɪl/ /bi/ /koʊld/.\\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\\n    *   /meɪbi/ corresponds to \\\"Maybe\\\".\\n    *   /təmɑroʊ/ matches with \\\"tomorrow\\\".\\n    *   /ɪt/ is recognized as \\\"it\\\".\\n    *   /wɪl/ is identified as \\\"will\\\".\\n    *   /bi/ corresponds to \\\"be\\\".\\n    *   /koʊld/ is matched with \\\"cold\\\".\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order.

The audio is identified as containing the sequence: /ðə/ (The) - /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ (surface) - /ɪz/ (is) - /slɪk/ (slick).\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each group of phonemes is matched against an extensive vocabulary model to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sound /ðə/ is recognized as the article \\\"The\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ are matched to the noun \\\"surface\\\".\\n    *   The sound /ɪz/ is identified as the verb \\\"is\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /slɪk/ are recognized as the adjective \\\"slick\\\".\\n4.  **Sentence Construction:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken. The resulting sequence, \\\"The surface is slick,\\\" is checked for grammatical correctness, confirming it forms a coherent and valid sentence.\\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, standard punctuation is applied. The first word is capitalized, and a period is added at the end to signify a complete declarative sentence.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"The surface is slick.\\\"<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nTranscribe the given verbal audio into written words.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 3]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Reasoning:**\\n\\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio is first processed to identify key acoustic features. It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a short, clear sentence.

It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a short, clear sentence. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\\n    *   The first sound cluster /ɪts/ is clearly identified as the common contraction \\\"It's\\\".\\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /əˈlɛvən/, is recognized as the word \\\"eleven\\\". The stress pattern on the second syllable is a key identifier.\\n    *   The final sound cluster, /əˈklɒk/, is a distinct and standard pronunciation for the term \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Assembly:** The identified words are then sequenced in the order they were spoken: \\\"It's\\\" + \\\"eleven\\\" + \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n4.  **Contextual Verification:** The resulting phrase, \\\"It's eleven o'clock,\\\" is a grammatically correct and common expression used to state the time.

The speaker is a male with a clear and steady voice.\\n\\n2.  **Word-by-Word Analysis:** The audio is replayed, pausing as needed to identify each word accurately.\\n    *   The first two words are identified as the contraction \\\"We'll\\\" followed by \\\"stop\\\".\\n    *   The next phrase is \\\"in a couple of\\\".\\n    *   The final word is clearly \\\"minutes\\\".\\n\\n3.  **Sentence Construction and Punctuation:** The identified words are assembled into a complete sentence. Since the sentence is a statement of intent, it concludes with a period.\\n\\n4.  **Final Review:** The complete transcribed sentence is compared against the audio one last time to ensure accuracy in wording and context.\\n\\nBased on this process, the spoken content is transcribed as:\\n\\nWe'll stop in a couple of minutes.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nTransform the given audio message into text form.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 4]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\\n\\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The process begins by receiving the audio file and analyzing its acoustic properties. The waveform shows a single, continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. I identify the sequence of sounds as they are spoken:\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"think\\\" (/θɪŋk/)\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"have\\\" (/hæv/)\\n    *   \\\"a\\\" (/ə/)\\n    *   \\\"doctor's\\\" (/ˈdɑktərz/)\\n    *   \\\"appointment\\\" (/əˈpɔɪntmənt/)\\n\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sounds /dɑktərz/ are distinctly recognized as the possessive \\\"doctor's,\\\" not the plural \\\"doctors,\\\" due to the context provided by the next word.\\n    *   The two-syllable word /əˈpɔɪntmənt/ is clearly identified as \\\"appointment.\\\"\\n\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly and Finalization:** The recognized words are assembled into a coherent sentence. A language model evaluates the sequence \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment\\\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment.\\\"<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nTurn the provided verbal audio into a text version.\\nDevelop your explanation in consecutive logical steps.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 5]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The process begins by receiving and analyzing the digital audio waveform. I identify a single, clear voice speaking a complete sentence at a conversational pace.\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The continuous audio stream is broken down into its core sound units, or phonemes. The recognized sequence is approximately: /meɪbi/ /təmɑroʊ/ /ɪt/ /wɪl/ /bi/ /koʊld/.\\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\\n    *   /meɪbi/ corresponds to \\\"Maybe\\\".\\n    *   /təmɑroʊ/ matches with \\\"tomorrow\\\".\\n    *   /ɪt/ is recognized as \\\"it\\\".\\n    *   /wɪl/ is identified as \\\"will\\\".\\n    *   /bi/ corresponds to \\\"be\\\".\\n    *   /koʊld/ is matched with \\\"cold\\\".\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order. The falling intonation at the end of the phrase indicates it is a declarative statement, so a period is added to form the final, grammatically correct sentence: \\\"Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.\\\"<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nConvert the provided spoken utterance into text.\\nOutline your answer step by step before concluding.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 6]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\"", "response": "**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The audio file is received and analyzed to identify the spoken words.

No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken utterance into text.\nOutline your answer step by step before concluding.\n**Model's Response**: **Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The audio file is received and analyzed to identify the spoken words.

"eval_messages": "You will be given a **question** and a **model's response**. The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken phrase into written text.\nFirst, think about the problem, then give the response.\n**Model's Response**: **Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The process begins by receiving and analyzing the digital audio waveform. I identify a single, clear voice speaking a complete sentence at a conversational pace.\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The continuous audio stream is broken down into its core sound units, or phonemes.

It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a short, clear sentence. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\\n    *   The first sound cluster /ɪts/ is clearly identified as the common contraction \\\"It's\\\".\\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /əˈlɛvən/, is recognized as the word \\\"eleven\\\". The stress pattern on the second syllable is a key identifier.\\n    *   The final sound cluster, /əˈklɒk/, is a distinct and standard pronunciation for the term \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Assembly:** The identified words are then sequenced in the order they were spoken: \\\"It's\\\" + \\\"eleven\\\" + \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n4.  **Contextual Verification:** The resulting phrase, \\\"It's eleven o'clock,\\\" is a grammatically correct and common expression used to state the time.

I identify a single, clear female voice speaking a short phrase. The speech is delivered at a natural pace with standard English pronunciation.\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Recognition:** The audio waveform is segmented into distinct phonetic units.\\n    *   The first segment consists of the sounds corresponding to the words \\\"Don't forget,\\\" recognized by their distinct consonant and vowel patterns.\\n    *   The second segment is a very short, unstressed vowel sound, which is identified as the article \\\"a\\\".\\n    *   The final segment contains the sounds for \\\"jacket,\\\" clearly identified by the initial \\\"j\\\" sound, the \\\"ack\\\" middle, and the concluding \\\"et\\\" sound.\\n3.  **Sentence Construction and Final Verification:** The recognized words—\\\"Don't,\\\" \\\"forget,\\\" \\\"a,\\\" and \\\"jacket\\\"—are assembled in sequential order to form the complete sentence. A final review of the audio confirms that this transcription accurately captures the spoken words and their intended meaning.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"Don't forget a jacket.\\\"<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nGenerate the textual representation of the provided spoken input.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 3]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Reasoning Steps:**\\n\\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The process starts by receiving the audio file and analyzing its sound wave characteristics, such as frequency, amplitude, and timing.\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its smallest distinct units of sound, called phonemes. The audio is identified as containing the sequence: /ðə/ (The) - /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ (surface) - /ɪz/ (is) - /slɪk/ (slick).\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each group of phonemes is matched against an extensive vocabulary model to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sound /ðə/ is recognized as the article \\\"The\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ are matched to the noun \\\"surface\\\".\\n    *   The sound /ɪz/ is identified as the verb \\\"is\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /slɪk/ are recognized as the adjective \\\"slick\\\".\\n4.  **Sentence Construction:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken. The resulting sequence, \\\"The surface is slick,\\\" is checked for grammatical correctness, confirming it forms a coherent and valid sentence.\\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, standard punctuation is applied. The first word is capitalized, and a period is added at the end to signify a complete declarative sentence.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"The surface is slick.\\\"<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nPut the words from the provided voice recording into text.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 4]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to transcribe the audio file:\\n\\n1.

Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\nThink critically about the question before answering.\n**Model's Response**: Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the transcription process:\n\n1.  **Initial Listening:** The audio is listened to in its entirety to get a general sense of the content, speaker, and clarity. The speaker is a male with a clear and steady voice.\n\n2.  **Word-by-Word Analysis:** The audio is replayed, pausing as needed to identify each word accurately.\n    *   The first word is \"He\".\n    *   The next word is \"could\".\n    *   The phrase \"hardly stand still\" is identified as a separate clause, with \"hardly\" as an adverb modifying \"stand.\"\n    *   The phrase \"so great was his mental agitation\" is identified as a separate clause, with \"so great\" as an adverb modifying \"agitation.\"\n    *   The phrase \"and he ran towards homes\" is identified as a separate clause, with \"and\" as a coordinating conjunction.\n    *   The phrase \"with two eager hands outstretched\" is identified as a separate clause, with \"with\" as a preposition and \"eager hands outstretched\" as a noun phrase.\n    *   The final word is \"thank heaven that you have come.\"\n\n3.  **Sentence Construction and Punctuation:** The identified words are assembled into a complete sentence. Since the sentence is a statement of gratitude, it concludes with a period.\n\n4.  **Final Review:** The complete transcribed sentence is compared against the audio one last time to ensure accuracy in wording and context.\n\nBased on this process, the spoken content is transcribed as:\n\nHe could hardly stand still, so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched, thank heaven that you have come.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the final paragraph that contains the direct transcription of the spoken content and removed the preceding explanatory and analytical text. I copied the transcription exactly as it appears in the model's response.\n\nResult: He could hardly stand still, so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched, thank heaven that you have come."}
