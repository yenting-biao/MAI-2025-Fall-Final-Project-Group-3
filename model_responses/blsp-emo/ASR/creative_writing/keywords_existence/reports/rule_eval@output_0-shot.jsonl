The victim, a wealthy businessman, had reported the theft of a large sum of money, and Smith was determined to find out who was responsible.\nAs he delved deeper into the investigation, Smith discovered that the victim had a history of being careless with his finances. He had been known to lend money to friends and family without doing proper background checks, and he had even been caught forging checks in the past.\nSmith knew that the victim's carelessness had made him an easy target for the thief. The thief had likely found the victim's forged check and used it to create a new one, which they then used to withdraw a large sum of money from the victim's account.\nSmith was angry that the victim had been so careless with his finances, and he was determined to bring the thief to justice. He knew that the thief had likely fled the area, but he was determined to track them down and bring them to trial.\nIn the end, Smith was able to track down the thief and bring them to justice. The thief was sentenced to prison for their crime, and the victim was able to recover his stolen money. Smith was happy that justice had been served, but he was also sad that the victim had been so careless with his finances. He knew that the victim's carelessness had made him an easy target for the thief, and he hoped that the victim would learn from his mistake and be more careful in the future.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true}
