The use of \"what\" and \"aren't\" suggests a lack of clarity and understanding, while the tone of the voice is hesitant and unsure. The audio creates a sense of unease and tension, leaving the listener wondering what exactly is going on between the two speakers."}

It's okay to feel uncertain or scared, but try to approach the situation with an open mind and a willingness to learn and grow.
