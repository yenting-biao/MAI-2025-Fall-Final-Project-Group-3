Opportunity rarely arrives with clear instructions; it comes as a challenge, a new path. Your choice is not to silence the wonder, but to answer it with action! Step forward and embrace that uncertainty, because *you* get to define what this is about. This is your moment.

It's okay to feel uncertain or scared, but try to approach the situation with an open mind and a willingness to learn and grow.
