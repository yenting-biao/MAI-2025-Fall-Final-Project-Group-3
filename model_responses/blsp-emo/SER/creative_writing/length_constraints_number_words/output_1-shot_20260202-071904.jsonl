The woman's voice is the only sound in the background, and it's clear that she's speaking to herself. There's a sense of stillness and contemplation in the air, as if the woman is lost in thought or reflecting on something important. The surrounding events are minimal, with no other sounds or distractions to break the silence. It's a peaceful, introspective moment, and the woman's voice adds to the sense of calm and tranquility."}
