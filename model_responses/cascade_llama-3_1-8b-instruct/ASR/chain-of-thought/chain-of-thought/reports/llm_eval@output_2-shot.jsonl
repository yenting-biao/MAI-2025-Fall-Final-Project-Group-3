Flattery in my seeing. And my great mind most kingly drinks it up. My eye well knows what with his gust is pleasing. And to his palate does prepare the cup. If it be poisoned. It is the lesser sin. That my eye loves it. And does first begin.\"\n\nThe final answer is: \"Oh, it is the first. Flattery in my seeing. And my great mind most kingly drinks it up.
