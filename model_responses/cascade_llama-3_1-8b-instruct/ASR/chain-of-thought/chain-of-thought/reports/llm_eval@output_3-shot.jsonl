The recognized sequence is approximately: /meɪbi/ /təmɑroʊ/ /ɪt/ /wɪl/ /bi/ /koʊld/.\\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\\n    *   /meɪbi/ corresponds to \\\"Maybe\\\".\\n    *   /təmɑroʊ/ matches with \\\"tomorrow\\\".\\n    *   /ɪt/ is recognized as \\\"it\\\".\\n    *   /wɪl/ is identified as \\\"will\\\".\\n    *   /bi/ corresponds to \\\"be\\\".\\n    *   /koʊld/ is matched with \\\"cold\\\".\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order.
