The resulting sentence is: \"I was bitkeeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.\"\n\n4.  **Final Review:** The complete transcribed sentence is reviewed to ensure accuracy in wording and context.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"I was bitkeeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response breaks the task into steps, describes intermediate actions (audio analysis, word-by-word identification, sentence construction, final review), and justifies the assembled sentence by explaining word choices and assembly.
