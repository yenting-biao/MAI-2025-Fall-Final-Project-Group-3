As we continue to explore the nature of memory and perception, it becomes increasingly clear that our confidence in the accuracy of a memory image is deeply tied to the characteristics of the image itself. However, as the speaker noted, we are often unable to directly compare the past bodily experience with the present image, which can lead to a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity. This raises important questions about the reliability of memory and the potential for misattribution or distortion of past events."}
