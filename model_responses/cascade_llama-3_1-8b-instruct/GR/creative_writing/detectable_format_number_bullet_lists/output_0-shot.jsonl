This may make the speech less engaging for the audience.\n\u2022 The speaker's pace is relatively fast, as seen in the short time ranges (e.g., 00:00:01 - 00:00:02, 00:00:05 - 00:00:06). This may make it difficult for listeners to follow the speech, especially if they are not familiar with the topic.\n\u2022 The speaker's language is formal and lacks enthusiasm, as evident from the use of complex words like \"induced horiva\" and the lack of emotional expression.\n\u2022 The speaker's delivery is direct and to the point, as seen in the short, simple sentences (e.g., \"Please, talk.\", \"tourists.\"). While this can be effective in some contexts, it may come across as abrupt or unengaging in others.\n\u2022 The speaker's lack of variation in tone, pace, and language may make the speech feel repetitive and uninteresting, which could negatively impact the audience's engagement and retention of the information."}
