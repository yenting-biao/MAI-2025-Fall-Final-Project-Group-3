The speaker's tone is neutral, which suggests that they are providing a factual or objective warning rather than expressing a personal opinion. The fact that the speaker's emotion is neutral also suggests that they are not trying to manipulate or persuade the listener, but rather provide information.\n\nHowever, I would like to add that the speaker's initial emotion of sadness may be related to the reason for the warning. It's possible that the speaker is warning someone about a potential danger or risk that they themselves have experienced or are concerned about. The speaker's sadness may be a personal investment in the warning, and a desire to prevent others from experiencing the same negative outcome.\n\nOverall, I agree with the speaker's idea that caution is necessary, and I appreciate their neutral and objective tone.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true}
