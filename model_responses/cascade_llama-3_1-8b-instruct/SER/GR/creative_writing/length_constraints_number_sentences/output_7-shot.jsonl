A question that's just not fair\n\nVerse 2:\nI try to find my place, but it's hard to stay\nWhen every step I take, it's just a step away\nFrom the truth that I've been hiding, from the pain that I've been feeling\nA world that's lost its heart, it's just a hollow revealing\n\nChorus:\nWill it suit you? A question I've been asked\nBut the answer's always the same, it's a taste of the past\nA world that's lost its way, in a sea of despair\nWill it suit you? A question that's just not fair"}
