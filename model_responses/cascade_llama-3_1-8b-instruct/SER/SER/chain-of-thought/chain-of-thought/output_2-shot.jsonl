The words \"we're bound to be poor forever\" are delivered with a sense of acceptance, rather than despair.\n*   **Pitch:** The pitch of the voice is relatively flat, without significant variation or inflection. This suggests a neutral or matter-of-fact tone.\n*   **Pace:** The pace of the speech is moderate, with a slight pause between the two sentences.
