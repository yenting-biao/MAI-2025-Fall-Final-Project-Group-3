The rhythm is steady and conversational.\n\n**Step 4: Volume Analysis**\nThe volume of the voice is moderate, without being loud or soft. This suggests that the speaker is not trying to emphasize or downplay their emotions.\n\n**Step 5: Contextual Analysis**\nThe words \"Sorry you came\" suggest that the speaker is expressing regret, but the context is not one of strong negative emotions. The speaker may be apologizing for an inconvenience or an unexpected visit.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nConsidering the polite tone, moderate pitch, normal pace, and moderate volume, the speaker's emotion is not strongly negative or positive.

There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand.

Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story.
