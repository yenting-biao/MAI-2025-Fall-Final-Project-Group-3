The casual dismissal of my efforts, the assumption that I had simply \"made\" One Bag, was a stark reminder of the lack of understanding that often surrounded my work. It was as if the speaker thought that creativity and craftsmanship were nothing more than a series of mundane tasks, devoid of passion or dedication.\n\nBut what they failed to see was the countless hours I had spent pouring my heart and soul into One Bag. The late nights, the early mornings, the endless iterations and refinements \u2013 it was all a labor of love, a testament to my commitment to my craft. And yet, the speaker's neutral tone made it sound like I had simply phoned it in, like I had slapped together a product without any care or consideration.\n\nTheir words stung, not because they were cruel or malicious, but because they were so... oblivious. They didn't see the blood, sweat, and tears that had gone into creating One Bag. They didn't see the joy and the pain, the triumphs and the setbacks. All they saw was a product, a thing, a commodity. And that was a hard pill to swallow."}

The speaker's fearful emotion suggests that they are worried about something, possibly a flight or a trip.\n\nThe scene unfolds in a small, cluttered airport office. A man, likely the speaker, sits across from a travel agent, who is trying to reassure him about the details of his trip. The man's fearful tone and the agent's calm demeanor create a sense of contrast, highlighting the man's anxiety.\n\nAs the conversation continues, the man's eyes dart back and forth, his brow furrowed in concern. The travel agent, sensing his unease, leans forward and begins to explain the benefits of flight insurance. The man's fearful emotion slowly gives way to a sense of relief as he begins to understand the agent's words, and the scene takes on a more hopeful tone."}
