The casual dismissal of my efforts, the assumption that I had simply \"made\" One Bag, was a stark reminder of the lack of understanding that often surrounded my work. It was as if the speaker thought that creativity and craftsmanship were nothing more than a series of mundane tasks, devoid of passion or dedication.\n\nBut what they failed to see was the countless hours I had spent pouring my heart and soul into One Bag. The late nights, the early mornings, the endless iterations and refinements – it was all a labor of love, a testament to my commitment to creating something truly special. And yet, the speaker's neutral tone made it sound like I had simply phoned it in, like One Bag was nothing more than a triviality.\n\nTheir words stung, but they also served as a wake-up call. I realized that I had been so focused on perfecting One Bag that I had forgotten to share its true value with the world. I needed to find a way to convey the emotional depth, the personal connection, and the sheer craftsmanship that went into creating something like One Bag. It was time to take a step back, to re-evaluate my approach, and to find a way to connect with people on a deeper level.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true}
