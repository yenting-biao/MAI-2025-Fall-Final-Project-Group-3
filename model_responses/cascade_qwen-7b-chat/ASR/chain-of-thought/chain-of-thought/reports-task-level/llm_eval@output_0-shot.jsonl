Clean up the transcript: The automatic transcription may contain errors or inconsistencies, so we need to clean it up and correct any mistakes.\n\n3. Remove punctuation marks: Punctuation marks such as commas, periods, and exclamation marks can distract from the meaning of the text, so we can remove them.\n\n4. Split the transcript into sentences: Sentences are the basic units of language, so we need to split the transcript into individual sentences.\n\n5. Normalize capitalization: Capitalizing proper nouns and titles can improve readability, so we can normalize the capitalization of the text.\n\nBased on these steps, the written text for the provided audio would be:\n\"Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in an action because I am a girl.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the line in the model's response that presents the transcribed text (inside quotes) and removed the surrounding explanatory text and quotes, keeping only the ASR transcription verbatim.\n\nResult: \"Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in an action because I am a girl.\"", "correct": 0.125}
