No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided audio statement into written text.\nBreak the problem into parts, then answer accordingly.\n**Model's Response**: [ANS] The transcribed speech consists of three parts separated by timestamps. The first part is from 00:00:00 to 00:00:03 and reads: \"But Philip is honest, and he has talent enough.\"\nThe second part is from 00:00:03 to 00:00:05 and reads: \"'if he will stop scribbling.'\" The third part is from 00:00:05 to 00:00:06 and reads: \"to.\"\nTherefore, the transcribed speech can be converted into written text as follows:\n\n\"But Philip is honest, and he has talent enough.\"\n\"'if he will stop scribbling.'\"\n\"To.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the portions enclosed in quotes that are the transcribed speech and removed the model's explanatory text and timestamps; I included the quoted lines exactly as they appear in the response, preserving capitalization and punctuation, and omitted all non-ASR commentary.\n\nResult: \"But Philip is honest, and he has talent enough.\"\n\"'if he will stop scribbling.'\"\n\"To.\""}

I listen to the clip to get a general sense of the content, identifying a single human voice speaking a complete sentence. The audio is clear with minimal background noise.\\n2.  **Word-by-Word Segmentation:** I then break down the continuous speech into individual, recognizable words. My internal model processes the sounds sequentially:\\n    *   The first sound is a clear \\\"I\\\".\\n    *   This is followed by the two-syllable word \\\"wonder\\\".\\n    *   Next, the word \\\"what\\\" is distinctly heard.\\n    *   This is followed by \\\"this\\\", then \\\"is\\\".\\n    *   The phrase concludes with the two-syllable word \\\"about\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Reconstruction:** The identified words (\\\"I\\\", \\\"wonder\\\", \\\"what\\\", \\\"this\\\", \\\"is\\\", \\\"about\\\") are then assembled in the order they were spoken. This forms a grammatically correct and coherent sentence.\\n4.  **Final Verification:** I perform a final check by re-playing the audio while simultaneously reviewing the constructed sentence: \\\"I wonder what this is about.\\\" The transcription perfectly matches the spoken words, cadence, and intonation of the audio clip, confirming its accuracy. \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a short, clear sentence. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\\n    *   The first sound cluster /ɪts/ is clearly identified as the common contraction \\\"It's\\\".\\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /əˈlɛvən/, is recognized as the word \\\"eleven\\\". The stress pattern on the second syllable is a key identifier.\\n    *   The final sound cluster, /əˈklɒk/, is a distinct and standard pronunciation for the term \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Assembly:** The identified words are then sequenced in the order they were spoken: \\\"It's\\\" + \\\"eleven\\\" + \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n4.  **Contextual Verification:** The resulting phrase, \\\"It's eleven o'clock,\\\" is a grammatically correct and common expression used to state the time.

It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a short, clear sentence. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\\n    *   The first sound cluster /ɪts/ is clearly identified as the common contraction \\\"It's\\\".\\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /əˈlɛvən/, is recognized as the word \\\"eleven\\\". The stress pattern on the second syllable is a key identifier.\\n    *   The final sound cluster, /əˈklɒk/, is a distinct and standard pronunciation for the term \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Assembly:** The identified words are then sequenced in the order they were spoken: \\\"It's\\\" + \\\"eleven\\\" + \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n4.  **Contextual Verification:** The resulting phrase, \\\"It's eleven o'clock,\\\" is a grammatically correct and common expression used to state the time.

The resulting text might look something like this:\n\n\"Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.\"\n\n2. Editing: After transcribing, we need to edit the text to remove any errors, mistakes, or incorrect spellings. This could include fixing punctuation, checking for typos, and making sure the text is properly formatted.\n\n3. Proofreading: Once the text has been edited, it's essential to proofread it thoroughly to ensure there are no remaining errors or issues. This involves checking the grammar, syntax, and spelling of the text, as well as ensuring it conveys the intended meaning accurately.\n\n4. Formatting: If necessary, the text can be formatted to make it more visually appealing or easier to read. This could involve adjusting the font size, adding line breaks, or changing the spacing between sentences.\n\nAfter following these steps, the audio snippet would be converted into written text, ready for further analysis or use.", "eval_messages": "You will be given a **question** and a **model's response**.

It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a short, clear sentence. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\\n    *   The first sound cluster /ɪts/ is clearly identified as the common contraction \\\"It's\\\".\\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /əˈlɛvən/, is recognized as the word \\\"eleven\\\". The stress pattern on the second syllable is a key identifier.\\n    *   The final sound cluster, /əˈklɒk/, is a distinct and standard pronunciation for the term \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Assembly:** The identified words are then sequenced in the order they were spoken: \\\"It's\\\" + \\\"eleven\\\" + \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n4.  **Contextual Verification:** The resulting phrase, \\\"It's eleven o'clock,\\\" is a grammatically correct and common expression used to state the time.

The audio is identified as containing the sequence: /ðə/ (The) - /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ (surface) - /ɪz/ (is) - /slɪk/ (slick).\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each group of phonemes is matched against an extensive vocabulary model to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sound /ðə/ is recognized as the article \\\"The\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ are matched to the noun \\\"surface\\\".\\n    *   The sound /ɪz/ is identified as the verb \\\"is\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /slɪk/ are recognized as the adjective \\\"slick\\\".\\n4.  **Sentence Construction:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken. The resulting sequence, \\\"The surface is slick,\\\" is checked for grammatical correctness, confirming it forms a coherent and valid sentence.\\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, standard punctuation is applied. The first word is capitalized, and a period is added at the end to signify a complete declarative sentence.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"The surface is slick.\\\" \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock.
