The first sentence suggests that achieving these things may not always be fortunate or intentional, but rather happen as a result of economic factors. The second sentence reinforces this idea by stating that achieving beauty or comfort must be done using methods that align with the economic principle of wasted effort. This suggests that there is a cost associated with achieving these things, and that efficiency and effectiveness are important considerations when making decisions about how to achieve them. Overall, the debate seems to be centered around the role of economics in determining how we pursue beauty and comfort."}
