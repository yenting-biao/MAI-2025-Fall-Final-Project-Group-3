They are not simply stating the time; they are exclaiming it as if it's a critical and problematic fact.\\n*   **Exasperated:** There is an undercurrent of frustration, suggesting that the time \\\"11 o'clock\\\" signifies that something is very late or a deadline has been missed, possibly despite a previous warning.\\n*   **Dramatic and Emphatic:** The speaker is intentionally emphasizing the time to maximize its impact on the listener. The delivery is theatrical and meant to convey a strong sense of crisis. \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.
