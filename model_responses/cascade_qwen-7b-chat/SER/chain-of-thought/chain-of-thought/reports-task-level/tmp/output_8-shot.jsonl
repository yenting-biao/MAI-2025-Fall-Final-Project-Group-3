Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] doctor's appointment.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Sad).\\nQuestion: Evaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent.

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] doctor's appointment.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Sad).\\nQuestion: Evaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah.

The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger.

It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

(Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] doctor's appointment.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand.

The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] doctor's appointment.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger.

The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy.

There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state.

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock! (Gender: Female, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Determine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Sad).\\nQuestion: Evaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy.

The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy.

The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion.

This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] doctor's appointment.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] doctor's appointment.

There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah.

The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy.

There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level.

(Gender: Female, Emotion: Sad).\\nQuestion: Evaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] doctor's appointment.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.

There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Sad).\\nQuestion: Evaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock! (Gender: Female, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Determine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket! (Gender: Female, Emotion: Happy).\\nQuestion: Focus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Sad).\\nQuestion: Evaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.

The speaker's voice is also slightly hoarse or rough, which may suggest excitement or enthusiasm. Overall, the combination of the speaker's tone, pitch, and pace, as well as the pause, suggest that the speaker is experiencing positive emotions such as happiness or surprise.", "eval_response": "Explanation: The model's response identifies positive emotions (happy/surprise) and concludes the speaker is experiencing happiness. This matches the ground truth category \"happy\" and provides supporting observations about tone, pitch, pace, and pauses without contradicting the ground truth.\n\nResult: YES"}

(Gender: Male, Emotion: Sad).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] I would like a new alarm clock. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Angry).\\nQuestion: Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] o'clock! (Gender: Female, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Determine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:02 - 00:00:03] Get a jacket!

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Maybe tomorrow it will be cold. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] We'll stop in a couple of minutes. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Neutral).\\nQuestion: Identify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:02] Yeah. (Gender: Male, Emotion: Disgusted).\\nQuestion: Pay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.\\n[00:00:01 - 00:00:03] I wonder what this is about. (Gender: Female, Emotion: Sad).\\nQuestion: Evaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.\\nAssistant:  [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** \\nUser: Below is an analysis of an audio file. \\nEach line contains: a time range, the transcribed speech, the speaker's perceived gender, the detected emotion \\n Please use this information to answer the question.
