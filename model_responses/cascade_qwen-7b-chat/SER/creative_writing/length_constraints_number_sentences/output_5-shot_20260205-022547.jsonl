The phrase \\\"Don't forget a jacket\\\" is a common, caring reminder given to someone who is about to go outside.

They deliver the line with a sense of extreme urgency and alarm, as if the time is critically important. The voice is loud and projects a feeling of exasperation, suggesting something is late or has been forgotten.
