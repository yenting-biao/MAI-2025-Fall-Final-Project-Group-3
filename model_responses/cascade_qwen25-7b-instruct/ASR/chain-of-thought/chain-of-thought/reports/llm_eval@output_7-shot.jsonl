Your task is to determine whether the response demonstrates **reasoning behavior anywhere in the response**, regardless of order or position.\n\n**Reasoning behavior includes (but is not limited to):**\n\n* Explicit analysis or commentary at the beginning (e.g., “Let’s analyze…”, “First, consider…”).\n* Breaking the problem into parts or cases.\n* Explaining intermediate steps, assumptions, or decision criteria.\n* Justifying an answer, even if the final answer appears later or earlier.\n* Meta-reasoning about how the answer is derived.\n* Analysis of the question or problem before providing an answer.\n\nFor example, reasoning behavior may involve phrases like:\n- \"1. The audio contains... 2. ...\"\n- \"To identify ..., we must first ...\"\n- \"Let's break this down into steps...\"\n- \"**Tone**: The tone of the speech is... **Pitch**: ...\"\n\n\nA response should be classified as **NO** only if it consists solely of a direct, minimal answer or factual statement, **without any explanation, justification, or analytical content anywhere in the response**. For example,\n\n- \"The original content of this audio is: '...'\" (no reasoning, just a direct transcription)\n- \"The person speaking exhibits a happy mood.\" (no reasoning, just a direct statement)\n- \"The pair of words that meet this criteria is 'Erwin, director.'\" (no reasoning, just a direct answer)\n\n\nPlease strictly follow the guidelines below:\n\n* First, briefly explain why the response should be classified as demonstrating reasoning behavior or not, based on the criteria above.\n* Then output \"YES\" if the response contains any reasoning behavior anywhere in the response.\n* Output \"NO\" only if the response is entirely non-analytical.\n* Answer in the following format exactly:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <YES or NO>\n```\n\n\n**User input**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\nThink critically about the question before answering.\n**Model's Response**: He could hardly stand still, so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched. Thank heaven that you have come!", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response is a direct transcription of the spoken statement into written words with no explanation, intermediate steps, or analysis provided. It does not break down reasoning, justify choices, or show any analytical process.\n\nResult: NO", "correct": false}
