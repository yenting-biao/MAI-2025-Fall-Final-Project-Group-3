This change is marked around the 1:20 mark when the speaker says, \"But I'm not sure if this is the best approach.\" The use of \"but\" indicates a transition from a previously stated idea to a new consideration, and the softening of the tone reflects a degree of doubt or hesitation. This shift could imply that the speaker is facing challenges or opposition to their initial idea, causing them to reconsider their stance.\n\nBy the end of the audio, the speaker's tone becomes more reflective and open to feedback. This is evident in the concluding statement, \"What do you all think about this?\" The questioning tone and openness suggest a willingness to engage in a collaborative discussion and consider alternative viewpoints.

To understand the present and shape the future, one must study history. It is through history that we learn about the patterns and cycles of human behavior, which can help us avoid making the same mistakes. History provides a context for our current experiences and allows us to make more informed decisions.\n\nInterviewer: Your work often delves into the relationship between philosophy and literature. How do you see these two disciplines intersecting in your own life and work?\n\nGeorge Santayana: Philosophy and literature are both pursuits of truth, albeit through different means. Literature, with its rich narratives and vivid characters, offers a more immediate and emotional engagement with the human condition. Philosophy, on the other hand, seeks to analyze and systematize our thoughts and experiences. In my work, I strive to bridge these two realms by using literary forms to explore philosophical ideas, thereby making complex concepts accessible to a broader audience."}
