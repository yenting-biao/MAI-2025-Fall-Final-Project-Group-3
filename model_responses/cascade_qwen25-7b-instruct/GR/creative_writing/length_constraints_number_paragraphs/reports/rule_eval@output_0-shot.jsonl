How do you think modern historians can ensure they are not influenced by their own biases when writing about the past?\n\n**Historical Figure:** Ah, a very astute question. The key lies in rigorous research and a commitment to objectivity. Historians must engage with a wide array of sources, including those that might challenge their preconceptions.
