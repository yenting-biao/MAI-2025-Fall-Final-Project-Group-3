Each home he painted seemed to bring him a little closer to his grandmother, who had taught him the art. The sadness in his voice deepened as he recalled the intricate floral designs and elegant landscapes that filled those walls. He missed the warmth and comfort those paintings brought to each family, a small reminder of his own heritage. Every brush stroke reminded him of the stories his grandmother would tell, and the joy she found in creating beauty.
