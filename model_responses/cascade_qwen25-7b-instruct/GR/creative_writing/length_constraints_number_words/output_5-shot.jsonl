It's almost comical how they try to replicate our inflections and tones, yet it always falls short. They might say, \"Hello, how are you?\" but it sounds robotic and lifeless. It's frustrating because these imitations are supposed to make interactions smoother, but they often feel awkward and unnatural. Sometimes, I catch myself waiting for them to get it right, to understand the nuances of human conversation, but they never quite do.
