This could indicate a breakdown in communication channels or a perception that automated systems are insufficient for addressing complex issues. The speaker's hope that someone can \"change it from now on\" suggests a desire for systemic change rather than just a temporary fix, reflecting a broader frustration with ongoing problems that have persisted over time.\n\nOverall, the speaker's message highlights the challenges of navigating modern systems that often rely heavily on technology at the expense of human interaction.
