As a rare book restorer, her days were spent in the hushed company of brittle paper and faded ink, mending the histories of others while her own remained deliberately uneventful. Her small apartment, filled with the scent of old leather and brewing tea, was a sanctuary from a world she found too loud, too unpredictable. She preferred the predictable rhythm of her work, the familiar faces at the local market, and the comforting weight of a book in her lap each evening. Surprises were unwelcome guests, and she had built walls of routine high enough to keep them out.\\n\\nThose walls were breached on a Tuesday by a single, thick, cream-colored envelope that arrived in the mail. It bore no return address, only a single, unfamiliar crest pressed into a dark wax seal—a raven clutching a key. The heavy, expensive paper felt alien in her hands, a stark contrast to the usual bills and catalogues. It was addressed to her in a swirling, archaic script that spoke of generations of wealth and secrets. For hours, the letter sat unopened on her small kitchen table, a silent accusation against the peaceful order of her life. It represented a connection to a past she knew nothing about, a disruption she wasn't prepared to face.\\n\\nThis was the source of her deep unease. Elara was an orphan, raised by a foster system that offered safety but few answers. She had no known family, no heirlooms, no stories of her lineage. The crest on the seal, the elegant script—it all pointed to a world she had never been a part of, a history that had been deliberately kept from her. Every instinct she had honed over a lifetime of self-preservation screamed at her to throw it away, to pretend it never arrived. Yet, a deeper, long-dormant flicker of curiosity began to stir within her, a yearning for the one thing she never had: a beginning.\\n\\nWith a trembling hand, she finally picked up the envelope, the wax seal cool against her thumb. The silence in her apartment seemed to deepen, amplifying the frantic beat of her own heart.
