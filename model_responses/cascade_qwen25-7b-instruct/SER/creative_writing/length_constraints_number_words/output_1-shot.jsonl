As relationships evolve beyond traditional professional and personal boundaries, individuals often find themselves in ambiguous situations. Such interactions can be challenging, as they require individuals to navigate their feelings and establish appropriate boundaries without appearing either too distant or overly familiar. Understanding these nuances can help in building more meaningful and balanced interpersonal connections in diverse social settings."}
