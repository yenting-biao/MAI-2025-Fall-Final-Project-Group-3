The sound of soft background chatter and the occasional rustle of pages flipping from a nearby bookshelf fills the air. A gentle hum from an old television in the corner suggests it might be on low volume, perhaps tuned to a news channel. The male speaker, whose voice carries a neutral tone, breaks the silence with a simple \"Right,\" indicating agreement or acknowledgment of something previously discussed. The room is cozy, with warm lighting from a few scattered lamps casting a soft glow on the faces of the speakers. Outside, the sound of distant traffic hints at the presence of the city beyond the windows, adding a layer of urban tranquility to the scene."}
