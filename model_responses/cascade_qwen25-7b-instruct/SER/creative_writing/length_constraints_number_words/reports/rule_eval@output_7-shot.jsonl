Suddenly, one friend pauses and says, \"Right.\" The pause is brief, but it breaks the flow of the conversation, drawing attention to the statement. The other friend looks up, perhaps slightly confused or curious, as they await further explanation. The room is warm and cozy, with the faint glow of a fireplace casting shadows on the walls.
