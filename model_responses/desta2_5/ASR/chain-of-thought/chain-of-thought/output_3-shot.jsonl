The falling intonation at the end of the phrase indicates it is a declarative statement, so a period is added to form the final, grammatically correct sentence: \\\"Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.\\\" \"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Put the words from the provided voice recording into text.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.\", \"audios\": [{\"audio\": \"./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav\", \"text\": null}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \" [ANS] Here is the step-by-step reasoning to transcribe the audio file:\\n\\n1.
