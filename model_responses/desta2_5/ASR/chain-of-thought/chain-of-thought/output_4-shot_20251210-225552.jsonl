The resulting sequence, \"I'm going to the store,\" is checked for grammatical correctness, confirming it forms a coherent and valid sentence.\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, standard punctuation is applied. The sentence is written in the correct grammatical form, with the first word capitalized and a period at the end to signify a complete declarative sentence.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"I'm going to the store.\""}
