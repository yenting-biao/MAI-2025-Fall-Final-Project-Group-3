The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\nThink critically about the question before answering.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The process begins by receiving the audio file and analyzing its acoustic properties. The waveform shows a continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. I identify the sequence of sounds as they are spoken:\n    *   \"he\" (/hi/)\n    *   \"could\" (/kʊld/)\n    *   \"hardly\" (/ˈhɑrdli/)\n    *   \"stand\" (/stænd/)\n    *   \"still\" (/stɪl/)\n    *   \"so\" (/soʊ/)\n    *   \"great\" (/greɪt/)\n    *   \"was\" (/wɒz/)\n    *   \"his\" (/hɪz/)\n    *   \"mental\" (/ˈmɛntəl/)\n    *   \"agitation\" (/ædʒɪˈteɪʃən/)\n    *   \"and\" (/ænd/)\n    *   \"he\" (/hi/)\n    *   \"ran\" (/ræn/)\n    *   \"towards\" (/təˈwɔːrds/)\n    *   \"holmes\" (/hoʊmz/)\n    *   \"with\" (/wɪθ/)\n    *   \"two\" (/tuː/)\n    *   \"eager\" (/ˈiːɡər/)\n    *   \"hands\" (/hændz/)\n    *   \"outstretched\" (/aʊtˈstrɛtʃt/)\n    *   \"thank\" (/θæŋk/)\n    *   \"heaven\" (/ˈheɪvən/)\n    *   \"that\" (/ðæt/)\n    *   \"you\" (/juː/)\n    *   \"have\" (/hæv/)\n    *   \"come\" (/kʌm/)\n\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words.\n    *   The sequence /hɑrdli/ is recognized as the adverb \"hardly.\"\n    *   The sequence /stænd/ is identified as the verb \"stand.\"\n    *   The", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the continuous spoken-word transcription within the model's response (the list of words and the quoted phrase at the end) and removed the surrounding analysis, phonetic details, and commentary. I copied the exact substring that represents the transcribed sentence.\n\nResult: \"he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come\"", "correct": 0.0}
