The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken passage into written text.\nTake a structured approach and explain each step.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Transcription:**\n\n1.  **Audio Analysis:** The audio is first analyzed to identify the speaker, tone, and content. The speaker is a female, 42 years old, Caucasian, not Hispanic, and not African American. The tone is neutral, and the voice is clear and steady.\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The audio is broken down into its smallest units of sound, or phonemes. The sequence of sounds is identified as:\n    *   /aʊr/ (Our)\n    *   /fɪrst/ (first)\n    *   /ɪmprɛʃənz/ (impressions)\n    *   /ɔf/ (of)\n    *   /pɪpəl/ (people)\n    *   /ɑr/ (are)\n    *   /ɪn/ (in)\n    *   /naɪn/ (nine)\n    *   /kæz/ (cases)\n    *   /aʊt/ (out)\n    *   /tɛn/ (ten)\n    *   /ðə/ (the)\n    *   /raɪt/ (right)\n    *   /ɪmprɛʃənz/ (impressions)\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic sequence is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most probable words.\n    *   The sounds /aʊr/ are recognized as the possessive pronoun \"our\".\n    *   The sequence /fɪrst/ is identified as the adjective \"first\".\n    *   The sounds /ɪmprɛʃənz/ are matched to the noun \"impressions\".\n    *   The sound /ɔf/ is recognized as the preposition \"of\".\n    *   The sequence /pɪpəl/ is identified as the noun \"people\".\n    *   The sound /ɑr/ is identified as the verb \"are\".\n    *   The sounds /ɪn/ are recognized as the preposition \"in\".\n    *   The sequence /naɪn/ is matched to the number \"nine\".\n    *   The sounds /kæz/ are identified as the noun \"cases\".\n    *   The sound /aʊt/ is recognized as the preposition \"out\".\n    *   The sequence /tɛn/ is identified as the number \"ten\".\n    *   The sound /ðə/ is recognized as the article \"the\".\n    *   The sequence /raɪt/ is matched to the adjective \"right\".\n    *   The sounds /ɪmprɛʃənz/ are identified as the noun \"impressions\".\n4.  **Sentence Construction and Punctuation:** The recognized words are assembled into a complete sentence. The sentence is a statement, so a period is added at the end.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"Our first impressions of people are, in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the final transcribed sentence in the model's response and removed all preceding explanatory and meta-content, leaving only the spoken text that was presented as the transcription.\n\nResult: Our first impressions of people are, in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions.", "correct": 0.0}
