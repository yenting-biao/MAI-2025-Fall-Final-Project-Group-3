The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided speech into text.\nGo through the solution step by step.\n**Model's Response**:  [ANS] **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Audio Analysis:** The audio file is first processed to analyze its acoustic properties. I identify a single, clear voice speaking a short, forceful sentence. The speaker is a female, and the tone is one of anger.\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The audio is broken down into its core sound units, or phonemes.\n    *   The first sequence of sounds corresponds to the word \"Father\".\n    *   The next sequence is identified as \"these\".\n    *   The word \"unjust\" is recognized by its distinct sound pattern.\n    *   The name \"Philip\" is identified by its phonetic pattern.\n    *   The phrase \"He's going into\" is recognized by its distinct sound sequence.\n    *   The final word is \"business\".\n3.  **Sentence Construction and Verification:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken. A final review of the audio confirms that this transcription accurately captures the spoken words and their intended meaning.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"Father, these unjust to Philip! He's going into business.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the model's final transcribed sentence within the response and removed all preceding explanatory and meta-content, keeping only the ASR transcription verbatim.\n\nResult: \"Father, these unjust to Philip!
