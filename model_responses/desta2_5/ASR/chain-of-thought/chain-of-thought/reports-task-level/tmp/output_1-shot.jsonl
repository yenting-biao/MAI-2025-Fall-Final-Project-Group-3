This logical and contextual consistency confirms the accuracy of the transcription.\n\n**Answer:** Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time, and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the final paragraph labeled \"Answer:\" as the ASR transcription and removed the preceding reasoning and commentary.
