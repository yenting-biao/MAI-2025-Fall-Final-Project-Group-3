The audio is identified as a single, clear voice with a neutral tone and minimal background noise.\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its smallest units of sound, or phonemes. The audio is segmented into the following sequence:\n    *   /aʊr/ (Our)\n    *   /fɪrst/ (first)\n    *   /ɪmpresʃənz/ (impressions)\n    *   /ɔv/ (of)\n    *   /pɪpəl/ (people)\n    *   /ɑr/ (are)\n    *   /ɪn/ (in)\n    *   /naɪn/ (nine)\n    *   /kæz/ (cases)\n    *   /aʊt/ (out)\n    *   /tɛn/ (ten)\n    *   /ðə/ (the)\n    *   raɪt/ (right)\n    *   impresʃənz/ (impressions)\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a comprehensive vocabulary model to identify the most probable words.\n    *   The sounds /aʊr/ are recognized as the possessive pronoun \"our\".\n    *   The sounds /fɪrst/ are matched to the adjective \"first\".\n    *   The sequence /ɪmpresʃənz/ is identified as the noun \"impressions\".\n    *   The sound /ɔv/ is recognized as the preposition \"of\".\n    *   The sounds /pɪpəl/ are matched to the noun \"people\".\n    *   The sound /ɑr/ is identified as the verb \"are\".\n    *   The sequence /ɪn/ is recognized as the preposition \"in\".\n    *   The sounds /naɪn/ are matched to the number \"nine\".\n    *   The sequence /kæz/ is identified as the noun \"cases\".\n    *   The sound /aʊt/ is recognized as the preposition \"out\".\n    *   The sequence /tɛn/ is matched to the number \"ten\".\n    *   The sound /ðə/ is identified as the indefinite article \"the\".\n    *   The sequence /raɪt/ is recognized as the adjective \"right\".\n    *   The sounds /impresʃənz/ are matched to the noun \"impressions\".\n4.  **Sentence Construction:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken. The resulting sequence, \"Our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions,\" is checked for grammatical correctness, confirming it forms a coherent and valid sentence.\n5.  **Final Verification:** I perform a final check by re-playing the audio while reviewing the constructed sentence. The transcription perfectly matches the spoken words, cadence, and intonation of the audio clip, confirming its accuracy.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"Our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the transcribed sentence embedded at the end of the response and removed all explanatory and meta-comment text, leaving only the exact ASR output phrase.\n\nResult: Our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions."}
