No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided speech into text.\nTake a structured approach and explain each step.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio is first processed to identify key acoustic features. It contains a single, clear voice, which sounds male, with a neutral tone and a slightly older age.

A final review of the audio confirms that this transcription accurately captures the spoken words and their intended meaning.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"The present chapters can only touch upon the more salient movements in Kansas which happily are not sanguinary if however the individual and more isolated cases of bloodshed could be described they would show a startling aggregate of loss of life for opinions' sake.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the final quoted sentence in the model's response identified as \"The final transcribed sentence is:\" and removed all preceding explanatory and meta-content.

No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken words into written text.\nReview the problem systematically before answering.\n**Model's Response**: Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the transcription process:\n\n1.  **Initial Listening:** The audio is listened to in its entirety to get a general sense of the content, speaker, and clarity. The speaker is a female with a clear and expressive voice.\n\n2.  **Word-by-Word Analysis:** The audio is replayed, pausing as needed to identify each word accurately.\n    *   The first phrase is \"Just smell the wild roses\".\n    *   The next phrase is \"they are always so spicy\".\n    *   The final phrase is \"after a rain\".\n\n3.  **Sentence Construction and Punctuation:** The identified phrases are assembled into a complete sentence. Since the sentence is a statement, it concludes with a period.\n\n4.  **Final Review:** The complete transcribed sentence is compared against the audio one last time to ensure accuracy in wording and context.\n\nBased on this process, the spoken content is transcribed as:\n\nJust smell the wild roses, they are always so spicy after a rain.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the final line of the model's response as the actual transcription and removed preceding explanation and step-by-step commentary so only the spoken text remains.\n\nResult: Just smell the wild roses, they are always so spicy after a rain."}

The speaker is a female, and the tone is one of relief and gratitude.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The audio is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\n    *   The first sequence /hi/ is identified as the word \"he\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /kʊd/ is recognized as \"could\".\n    *   The following sequence /hɑrdli/ is matched with \"hardly\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /stænd/ is identified as \"stand\".\n    *   The following sequence /stɪl/ is recognized as \"still\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /so/ is identified as \"so\".\n    *   The following sequence /greɪt/ is matched with \"great\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /wəz/ is recognized as \"was\".\n    *   The following sequence /hɪz/ is identified as \"his\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /mɛntəl/ is matched with \"mental\".\n    *   The following sequence /ægɪtˈeɪʃən/ is recognized as \"agitation\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /ænd/ is identified as \"and\".\n    *   The following sequence /hiz/ is recognized as \"he\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /ræn/ is identified as \"ran\".\n    *   The following sequence /tɔːwɑrdz/ is matched with \"towards\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /hɔːmz/ is recognized as \"Holmes\".\n    *   The following sequence /wɪð/ is identified as \"with\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /tuː/ is recognized as \"two\".\n    *   The following sequence /iː/ is identified as \"eager\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /hændz/ is matched with \"hands\".\n    *   The following sequence /aʊt/ is recognized as \"outstretched\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /θæŋk/ is identified as \"thank\".\n    *   The following sequence /hɛvən/ is matched with \"heaven\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /ðæt/ is recognized as \"that\".\n    *   The following sequence /jə/ is identified as \"you\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /hæv/ is matched with \"have\".\n    *   The following sequence /kʌm/ is recognized as \"come\".\n3.  **Sentence Construction and Punctuation:** The identified words are assembled into a complete sentence. Since the sentence is a statement of relief and gratitude, it concludes with a period.\n\n4.  **Final Review:** The complete transcribed sentence is compared against the audio one last time to ensure accuracy in wording and context.\n\nBased on this process, the spoken content is transcribed as:\n\nHe could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched. Thank heaven that you have come.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the final transcribed sentence in the model's response and removed all preceding analysis and commentary, leaving only the continuous ASR text.\n\nResult: He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched. Thank heaven that you have come."}
