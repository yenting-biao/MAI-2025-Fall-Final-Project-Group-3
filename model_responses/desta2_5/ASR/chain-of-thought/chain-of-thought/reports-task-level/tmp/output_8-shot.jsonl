No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken phrase into text.\nFirst, think about the problem, then give the response.\n**Model's Response**:  [ANS] **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Audio Analysis:** The audio is first analyzed to identify key characteristics, such as the speaker's voice, tone, and clarity. The speaker is a male with a clear and steady voice.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its smallest units of sound, or phonemes. The audio is identified as containing the sequence: /nɒt/ (Not) - /a/ (a) - /dʌʊt/ (doubt) - /bʌt/ (but) - /hæv/ (had) - /jɔ/ (your) - /fɔːrs/ (force) - /bɪn/ (been) - /ˈdʌbəl/ (double) - /ɔr/ (or) - /trʌbl/ (trouble) - /aʊ/ (our) - /aʊn/ (own) - /aɪ/ (I) - /ʃʊd/ (should) - /hæv/ (have) - /fɔːnd/ (found) - /ɪt/ (it) - /mʌɪ/ (my) - /dʌʈi/ (duty) - /tə/ (to) - /strʌɡɡl/ (struggle) - /wɪθ/ (with) - /juː/ (you).\n\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\n    *   The sounds /nɒt/ are recognized as the adverb \"Not\".\n    *   The sound /a/ is identified as the indefinite article \"a\".\n    *   The sequence /dʌʊt/ is matched to the noun \"doubt\".\n    *   The sound /bʌt/ is recognized as the conjunction \"but\".\n    *   The sounds /hæv/ are identified as the verb \"had\".\n    *   The sound /jɔ/ is matched to the possessive pronoun \"your\".\n    *   The sequence /fɔːrs/ is recognized as the noun \"force\".\n    *   The sound /bɪn/ is identified as the verb \"been\".\n    *   The sounds /ˈdʌbəl/ are matched to the adjective \"double\".\n    *   The sound /ɔr/ is recognized as the conjunction \"or\".\n    *   The sequence /trʌbl/ is identified as the noun \"trouble\".\n    *   The sound /aʊ/ is matched to the possessive pronoun \"our\".\n    *   The sequence /aʊn/ is recognized as the possessive pronoun \"own\".\n    *   The sound /aɪ/ is identified as the first-person singular pronoun \"I\".\n    *   The sequence /ʃʊd/ is matched to the auxiliary verb \"should\".\n    *   The sound /hæv/ is recognized as the verb \"have\".\n    *   The sequence /fɔːnd/ is identified as the verb \"found\".\n    *   The sound /ɪt/ is matched to the pronoun \"it\".\n    *   The sequence /mʌɪ/ is recognized as the possessive pronoun \"my\".\n    *   The sound /dʌʈi/ is identified as the noun \"duty\".\n    *   The sound /tə/ is matched to the preposition \"to\".\n    *   The sequence /strʌɡɡl/ is recognized as the verb \"struggle\".\n    *   The sound /wɪθ/ is identified as the preposition \"with\".\n    *   The sound /juː/ is matched to the pronoun \"you\".\n4.  **Sentence Construction and Punctuation:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken. The resulting sequence is a complex sentence with multiple clauses, so it is punctuated accordingly.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"Not a doubt, but had your force been double or trouble our own, I should have found it my duty to struggle with you.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the final transcribed sentence at the end of the model's response and removed all preceding analysis, phonetic breakdown, and meta-comments so only the ASR text remains.\n\nResult: Not a doubt, but had your force been double or trouble our own, I should have found it my duty to struggle with you."}
