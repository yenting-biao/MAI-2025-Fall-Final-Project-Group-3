The audio is of high quality, allowing for clear recognition of the spoken words.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The audio is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. The sequence of sounds is identified as:\n    *   \"Not\" (/nɒt/)\n    *   \"a\" (/ə/)\n    *   \"doubt\" (/daʊt/)\n    *   \"but\" (/bʌt/)\n    *   \"had\" (/hæd/)\n    *   \"your\" (/jɔːr/)\n    *   \"force\" (/fɔːrs/)\n    *   \"been\" (/biːn/)\n    *   \"only\" (/ʌnli/)\n    *   \"double\" (/dʌbəl/)\n    *   \"or\" (/ɔːr/)\n    *   \"trouble\" (/ˈtrʌbl/)\n    *   \"our\" (/aʊər/)\n    *   \"own\" (/oʊn/)\n    *   \"I\" (/aɪ/)\n    *   \"should\" (/ʃʊd/)\n    *   \"have\" (/hæv/)\n    *   \"found\" (/faʊnd/)\n    *   \"it\" (/ɪt/)\n    *   \"my\" (/maɪ/)\n    *   \"duty\" (/ˈdʌti/)\n    *   \"to\" (/tuː/)\n    *   \"struggle\" (/ˈstrʌɡəl/)\n    *   \"with\" (/wɪθ/)\n    *   \"you\" (/juː/)\n\n3.  **Word Recognition and Sentence Construction:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words. The recognized words are assembled into a coherent sentence. A language model evaluates the sequence as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English.\n\n4.  **Final Verification:** The transcribed sentence is reviewed to ensure accuracy.
