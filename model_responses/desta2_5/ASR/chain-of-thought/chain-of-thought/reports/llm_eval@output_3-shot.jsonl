A final review of the audio confirms that this transcription accurately captures the spoken words and their intended meaning.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"Not a doubt, but had your force been only double or trouble our own, I should have found it my duty to struggle with you.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response includes step-by-step analysis describing how the audio was processed (initial audio analysis, phonetic segmentation, word recognition, final verification) and explains intermediate conclusions and assumptions before giving the final transcription.
