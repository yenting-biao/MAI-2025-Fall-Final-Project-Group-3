A language model evaluates the sequence \"But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English.

The resulting sequence, \"Father, these unjust to Philip. He's going into business,\" is checked for grammatical correctness, confirming it forms a coherent and valid sentence.\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, standard punctuation is applied.
