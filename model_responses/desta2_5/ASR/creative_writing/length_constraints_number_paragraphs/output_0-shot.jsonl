The phrase \"put about\" is a nautical term that means to change direction, but in this context, it implies a sense of giving up and accepting the status quo. The speaker seems to be acknowledging that their efforts will be futile, and that they might as well accept their circumstances and move on.\n\nThe speaker's emotional state is one of melancholy and despair. The use of the phrase \"toward the north\" is a vague and ambiguous direction, which may symbolize the speaker's sense of directionlessness and uncertainty.

This could imply that the speaker is dealing with a sensitive or delicate situation, such as a personal conflict, a business dispute, or a confidential matter.\n\nThe speaker's emphasis on \"quietly and discreetly\" also suggests that they value privacy and confidentiality. This could be a reflection of their personality or a strategic decision to avoid drawing attention to themselves. In a broader sense, this message may also imply that the speaker is aware of the power of discretion and the importance of maintaining confidentiality in certain situations. This could be particularly relevant in professional or social settings where gossip or rumors can spread quickly and have far-reaching consequences.\n\nThe speaker's message may also be seen as a reflection of their values and priorities. By prioritizing discretion and quiet resolution, the speaker may be demonstrating a commitment to avoiding conflict or drama, and instead opting for a more measured and thoughtful approach.
