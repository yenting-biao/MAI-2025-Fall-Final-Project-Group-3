The word \"put about\" is a nautical term that implies a change in course, but in this context, it feels like a reluctant concession to the futility of their efforts. The speaker seems to be acknowledging that their efforts are unlikely to yield the desired result, and that they are better off accepting their circumstances and moving on.\n\nThe overall tone of the speaker's words is one of melancholy and acceptance. The speaker seems to be coming to terms with the fact that their expectations have not been met, and that they must now adjust to a new reality. The use of the phrase \"toward the north\" at the end of the passage suggests a sense of direction, but also a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.
