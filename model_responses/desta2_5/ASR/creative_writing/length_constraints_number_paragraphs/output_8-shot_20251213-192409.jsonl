This was Lena, the speaker's best friend and confidante, who had been waiting patiently outside the door, listening for the sound of the clock striking the hour. She had been the one who had urged her friend to hurry, to not be late, but now she saw the panic in her eyes and knew that it was too late. Lena's expression softened as she approached her friend, her voice gentle as she said, \"Hey, it's okay. It's not the end of the world.\"\n\nThe friend, still reeling from the shock of missing the deadline, looked up at Lena, her eyes brimming with tears. \"What am I going to do?\" she wailed, her voice cracking with despair. Lena's expression turned sympathetic, and she wrapped her arms around her friend, holding her close. \"We'll figure it out, together,\" she said, her words a soothing balm to the friend's frazzled nerves. As they stood there, the clock's ticking grew louder, a reminder of the time that had slipped away, but Lena's presence was a reminder that she was not alone.\n\nTogether, they stepped back into the room, the friend's tears subsiding as they began to talk through the situation. Lena's calm, level head helped to steady her friend's, and together, they brainstormed a plan to mitigate the damage. The clock's ticking still echoed in the background, a constant reminder of the time lost, but with Lena by her side, the friend felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, they could still salvage something from the wreckage of the missed deadline. As they worked, the clock's rhythmic beat began to fade into the background, replaced by the sound of their determined voices, plotting a new course forward."}

She groggily reached over to turn it off, only to realize it was dead, its batteries drained from the previous night's use. Panic set in as she scrambled to get out of bed, her mind racing with the thought of being late for work. She had a big presentation to give, and her boss had made it clear that tardiness was not an option. As she rushed to get dressed, she let out a loud, exasperated cry, \"I need a new alarm clock!\" The words echoed through the empty apartment, a declaration of frustration and desperation.\n\nShe stormed out of the door, grabbing her bag and keys, and rushed to the nearest electronics store. The sales associate, taken aback by her urgency, asked if she was okay, and she shot back, \"I just need a new alarm clock, now!\" The associate, sensing her distress, quickly led her to the clock section, and she began frantically scanning the shelves for the perfect one. Finally, she found it - a sleek, modern device with a soothing wake-up tone and a backup battery pack. She grabbed it, paid, and rushed back home, setting it to go off 10 minutes earlier than usual. As she lay in bed that night, she smiled, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. She had taken control of her morning, and the new alarm clock was already set to ensure she'd never be late again."}
