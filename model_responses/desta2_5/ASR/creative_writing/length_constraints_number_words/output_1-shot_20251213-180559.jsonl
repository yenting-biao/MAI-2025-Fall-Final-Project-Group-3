It's not every day I get to talk to someone about my... unique situation.\n\n**Interviewer:** So, can you tell us what happened? What did you hear?\n\n**The Voice:** Well, I was just walking down the hallway, and I heard a faint voice say \"Don't forget a jacket!\" It was so clear, like someone was standing right next to me. But when I turned around, there was no one there.\n\n**Interviewer:** That must have been quite startling. Did you recognize the voice?\n\n**The Voice:** Oh, yes. It was my late grandmother. I haven't heard her voice in years, but it was unmistakable. She used to say that to me all the time when I was a kid, whenever I was leaving her house.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's beautiful. Do you think it was just a memory or something more?\n\n**The Voice:** I don't know. It's hard to explain. It felt real, but at the same time, it didn't feel like it was coming from anyone in the physical world. It was like... a echo, I suppose.\n\n**Interviewer:** An echo from beyond? That's a fascinating idea. Have you experienced anything like this before?\n\n**The Voice:** Actually, yes. A few times since my grandmother passed away, I've heard her voice in my head, reminding me of things she used to say or do. But this was different. This was like she was trying to communicate with me, to tell me something.\n\n**Interviewer:** And what do you think she was trying to tell you?\n\n**The Voice:** (pauses) I'm not entirely sure. But I think she was just trying to remind me of the little things in life, to appreciate the small moments. She was always like that, reminding me to be grateful and not take things for granted.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's a wonderful message. And finally, do you think this experience has changed you in any way?\n\n**The Voice:** Yes, it has. It's made me realize that even though she's no longer with me physically, her spirit is still with me, watching over me. And that's a comforting thought.\n\n**Interview"}
