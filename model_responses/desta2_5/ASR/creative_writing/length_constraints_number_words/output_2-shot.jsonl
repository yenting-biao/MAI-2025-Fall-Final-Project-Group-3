By allowing themselves to be governed by a single, deliberate assembly, they have created a system that is prone to inefficiencies and power imbalances. This has resulted in a range of problems, from ineffective decision-making to a lack of representation for all citizens. The British people must re-examine their constitutional framework and consider alternative models that promote greater accountability, transparency, and representation. By doing so, they can work towards creating a more just and equitable society."}
