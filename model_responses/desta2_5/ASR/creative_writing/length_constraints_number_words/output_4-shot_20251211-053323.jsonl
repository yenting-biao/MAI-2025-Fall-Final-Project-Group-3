I was so excited to finally have a sense of independence and responsibility, but I was also nervous about waking up on time for my early morning classes. I chose a bright pink alarm clock with a fun design, hoping it would make waking up more enjoyable. It became a trusted companion, and I'd set it every night, feeling a sense of control over my day. That alarm clock became a symbol of my growing adulthood, a reminder that I was taking charge of my life."}
