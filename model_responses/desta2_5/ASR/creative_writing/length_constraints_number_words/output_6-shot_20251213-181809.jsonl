What's your name, and what inspired you to create this piece?\n\n**Voice:** My name is Emilia, and I'm a 57-year-old woman. I'm a writer and a philosopher, and I've always been fascinated by the human experience. I created \"A Simple Prediction\" as a reflection on the uncertainty of life. We often talk about the future in grand terms, but I wanted to capture the quiet moments of doubt that we all experience.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's really interesting. Your delivery is so calm and matter-of-fact. Can you tell us what you were thinking when you recorded that line, \"Maybe tomorrow it will be cold\"?\n\n**Voice:** (laughs) Ah, yes. I was actually thinking about a conversation I had with a friend who was worried about the weather. She was fretting about the cold, and I realized that we often get so caught up in our worries about the future. I wanted to capture that moment of uncertainty, that \"what-if\" that we all experience.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's really insightful. Your audio piece is so brief, but it's left us wanting more. Can you tell us what you have planned for future projects?\n\n**Voice:** (laughs) Well, I'm actually working on a series of short audio pieces that explore the human condition. I want to delve deeper into the moments we often overlook, the quiet moments that make us human. I'm excited to share more of my work with the world.\n\n**Interviewer:** Well, we can't wait! Thank you, Emilia, for sharing your thoughts with us today.\n\n**Voice:** Thank you for having me."}
