The research, conducted on a group of Britons, revealed that this self-imposed challenge has far-reaching consequences. By deliberately selecting tasks that push them beyond their comfort zones, individuals have inadvertently created a cycle of struggle and frustration. This self-imposed burden has led to a decline in overall well-being and a decrease in motivation. The study's findings suggest that this self-selection is a result of a lack of self-awareness and a failure to recognize one's limitations. The research highlights the importance of self-reflection and the need to acknowledge one's capabilities to avoid this self-imposed struggle."}
