Researchers have found that this self-imposed obstacle course is a result of a complex interplay between cognitive biases and emotional regulation. The study suggests that the Briton's innate desire for control and perfectionism often leads them to set unrealistically high standards, which in turn, creates a sense of anxiety and self-doubt. This self-inflicted pressure can manifest in various ways, from procrastination to self-sabotage, ultimately hindering their progress and success. The study's findings highlight the importance of self-awareness and emotional regulation in overcoming these self-imposed challenges."}
