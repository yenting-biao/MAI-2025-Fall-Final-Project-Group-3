Can you tell us a bit about your experience with providing birds, beasts, and fishes for dinner?\n\n**Mrs. Neverbend:** (chuckles) Ah, yes. Well, it's a long story, but I'll try to keep it brief. I used to run a small farm, and I took it upon myself to ensure that every meal was prepared with the freshest ingredients. I'd venture out into the woods, catch the birds, hunt the beasts, and fish in the nearby stream. It was a lot of work, but I took pride in it.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's impressive. And what about the tarts and jellies? How did those fit into the menu?\n\n**Mrs. Neverbend:** (laughs) Oh, those were my daughter's specialty. She was quite the baker, and she'd make these delightful tarts and jellies to accompany the main course. She'd spend hours in the kitchen, experimenting with different flavors and ingredients. I must say, she was quite the culinary genius.\n\n**Interviewer:** I see. And what was the most challenging part of this process?\n\n**Mrs. Neverbend:** (pauses) I think it was the logistics, to be honest. Coordinating the hunting, fishing, and baking all while ensuring everything was ready at the same time was a feat in itself. But, as I said, I managed to pull it off with thorough success.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true}
