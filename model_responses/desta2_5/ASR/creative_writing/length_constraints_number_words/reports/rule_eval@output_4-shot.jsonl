As a chef, I had to prepare a rather...unusual dinner for my guests. Birds, beasts, and fish, all while ensuring the tarts and jellies were prepared to perfection. It was a challenge, but I'm proud to say I rose to the occasion.\n\n**Interviewer:** I see. And what inspired this...unconventional menu?\n\n**Mrs. Neverbend:** Oh, I like to think outside the box, dear. I wanted to surprise my guests with something new and exciting. And, of course, I had to make sure everything was done to my high standards.\n\n**Interviewer:** I understand. And what do you hope our audience takes away from your experience?\n\n**Mrs. Neverbend:** I hope they see that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.
