Model's response is a reply to the question. Your task is to judge if \"model's response\" aligns with the \"ground Truth answer\" based on the \"question\".\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n* Judge alignment based on semantic correctness, not surface-level wording.\n* Minor paraphrasing or differences in expression are acceptable if the meaning is equivalent.\n* If the model's response misses essential information, or contradicts the ground truth answer, it should be considered non-aligned.\n\nPlease strictly follow the guidelines below:\n* First, provide a brief explanation why the response aligns or does not align with the ground truth answer, based on the criteria above.\n* Then Output \"YES\" if the response aligns with the ground truth answer; output \"NO\" if the response does not match the ground truth answer.\n* Answer in the following format exactly:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <YES or NO>\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Determine the sex of the speaker in this sound file. Choose the answer from \"Male\" or \"Female\"\nReview the problem systematically before answering.\n**Ground Truth Answer**: Male\n**Model's Response**: Based on the audio input, I can analyze the following:\n\n* The speaker's tone and language used are informal and conversational, which is more typical of male speech patterns.\n* The speaker's voice sounds deep and rough, which is also consistent with male vocal characteristics.\n* The speaker's name, \"Ross\", is also a traditionally male name.\n\nTherefore, based on these observations, I would determine that the sex of the speaker is:\n\nMale", "eval_response": "Explanation: The model's response concludes \"Male\" and provides supporting observations (deep/rough voice, male name) that match the ground truth. Although some cues (tone, name) are not definitive, the final classification agrees with the ground truth answer.\n\nResult: YES", "correct": true}
