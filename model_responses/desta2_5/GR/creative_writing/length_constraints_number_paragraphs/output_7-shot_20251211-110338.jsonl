I made a mental list of questions to ask them later, but for now, I just kept working, trying to focus on the task at hand.\n\nThe speaker's matter-of-fact tone was a bit of a relief, actually.

As an orphan, I never really had a sense of my own history, so I found solace in the stories of others. I spent countless hours in the local library, devouring books and imagining the lives of the people who wrote them.

I get to be a part of preserving the past, of giving new life to these forgotten tales.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's beautiful. Your work is not just about restoring books, but also about uncovering the stories within them. I understand you recently received a mysterious letter that's been causing quite a stir. Can you tell us about that? What's going on, and how are you processing this unexpected turn of events?\n\n**Elara:** (pauses, collecting her thoughts) Ah, yes. The letter. It's... complicated. I've never been one for surprises, and this one has shaken me to my core. The crest on the seal, the script... it all points to a world I've never known, a history that's been kept from me. I'm not sure what to make of it, to be honest. Part of me wants to ignore it, to pretend it never arrived. But another part...
