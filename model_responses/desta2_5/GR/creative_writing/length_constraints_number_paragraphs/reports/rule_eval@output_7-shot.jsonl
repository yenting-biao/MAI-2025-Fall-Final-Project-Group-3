The speaker's tone is one of wistful nostalgia, as if recalling a past event or memory that is both bittersweet and regretful.\n\nThe significance of this phrase lies in its ability to evoke a sense of longing and yearning. The speaker seems to be reflecting on a past love affair that was doomed from the start, perhaps due to social class differences, family opposition, or other external factors.

The speaker's tone is melancholic, suggesting that the love has ended, and the speaker is now looking back on it with a mix of sadness and nostalgia.
