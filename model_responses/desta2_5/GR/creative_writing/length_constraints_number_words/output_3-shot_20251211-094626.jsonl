The rhythm is slow and deliberate, suggesting the speaker is recalling information rather than stating it with urgency. The pitch is low and remains relatively monotonous, which strips the statement of strong emotion and imparts a feeling of mundane resignation. A brief, natural pause after \\\"I think\\\" reinforces this thoughtful quality, making the delivery feel authentic and unscripted.
