The words \"single-mindedness with no mind\" and \"urgency that's pure urge\" suggest a sense of intensity and passion, which is often associated with anger. The speaker's statement that \"they didn't make any decisions\" and \"they don't ask it any questions\" also implies a sense of criticism or disapproval, which is consistent with an angry tone.", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response includes explicit analysis and justification: it states acoustic cues (\"high-pitched and fast\"), links those cues to emotional states (\"urgency and frustration\"), cites specific quoted phrases from the audio as evidence, and explains how those support the \"angry\" classification.

The high pitch and low volume may add to the sense of melancholy, but the overall tone is more subdued than angry or happy.", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response breaks down the judgment into factors (tone, pitch, volume, context), explains how each factor is interpreted, and then justifies the final emotion label based on that analysis.
