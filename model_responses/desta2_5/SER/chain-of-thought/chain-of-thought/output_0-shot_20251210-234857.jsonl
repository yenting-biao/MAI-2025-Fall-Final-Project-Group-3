The pitch is not rising or falling in a way that suggests excitement or enthusiasm.\n3. **Pace:** The speaker's pace is moderate, but there are moments where the pace slows down, which can indicate a sense of hesitation or uncertainty. This could be a sign of sadness or nervousness.\n4. **Volume:** The speaker's volume is relatively low, which suggests that they are not trying to convey a sense of excitement or aggression. This could be a sign of sadness or introspection.\n5. **Context:** The speaker is discussing a difficult situation, and their words convey a sense of disappointment and frustration. The speaker's tone and language suggest that they are struggling to cope with their emotions, which is consistent with sadness.\n6. **Language:** The speaker uses words and phrases that convey a sense of sadness, such as \"I don't know\" and \"it's just not working out\". The speaker's language is not overly dramatic or confrontational, which suggests that they are not trying to express anger or aggression.\n\nOverall, taking into account the speaker's tone, pitch, pace, volume, context, and language, I believe that the speaker is expressing sadness."}
