Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.\\n [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand.

The speaker's tone is not particularly warm, friendly, or enthusiastic, which suggests a lack of emotional expression.\n\n**Step 2: Pitch**\nThe pitch of the speaker's voice is relatively steady and even, without any significant variations or changes in intonation. The pitch is not particularly high or low, which suggests a neutral emotional state.\n\n**Step 3: Speed**\nThe speaker's pace is moderate, with a steady flow of words. There are no noticeable pauses or hesitations, which suggests that the speaker is speaking confidently and clearly.\n\n**Step 4: Volume**\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is normal, without any significant variations or changes. The speaker is not speaking loudly or softly, which suggests a neutral emotional state.\n\n**Step 5: Notable pauses or changes in inflection**\nThere are no notable pauses or changes in inflection in the spoken utterance. The speaker's voice is steady and even throughout, without any significant breaks or changes in tone.\n\n**Synthesis of cues**\nBased on the tone, pitch, speed, volume, and lack of notable pauses or changes in inflection, I would categorize the emotion of the spoken utterance as **Neutral**.
