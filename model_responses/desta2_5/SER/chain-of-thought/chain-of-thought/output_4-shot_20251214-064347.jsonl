Instead, the tone is soothing and reassuring, indicating a neutral or positive emotional state.\n\n*   **Pitch:** The pitch of the voice is low and steady, without any significant upward or downward shifts.

This measured pace suggests a low state of emotional arousal, which is consistent with a neutral or calm emotional state.\n\n*   **Pauses:** There is a brief pause after \"hold on,\" which adds to the calming effect of the tone.
