This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance.

This consistent pace is characteristic of neutral or informative speech, as opposed to the rapid pace of excitement or the slow pace of sadness.\n\n*   **Word Choice:** The speaker uses words like \"definitely\" and \"of course,\" which convey a sense of reassurance and cooperation. These words are typically used in a friendly or professional context, rather than in a negative or confrontational one.\n\n*   **Synthesis of Observations:** The combination of a calm tone, stable pitch, steady pace, and reassuring word choice all point to a neutral or professional emotional state.\n\nNeutral", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response breaks the judgment into explicit analytic parts (tone, pitch, pace, word choice) and explains how each observation leads to the final classification, then synthesizes them.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad \"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion.

There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry \"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Determine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice.

This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry \"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Focus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words.
