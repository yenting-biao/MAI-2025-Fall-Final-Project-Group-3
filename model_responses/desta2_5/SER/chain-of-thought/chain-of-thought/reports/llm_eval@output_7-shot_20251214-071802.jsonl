For example, high-pitched tone and rising intonation are linked to excitement or enthusiasm. Fast pace with urgency and energy is connected to high-arousal states like happiness. High pitch is associated with positive emotions. The Korean phrase \"대박이야\" is translated as \"That's amazing\" or \"That's great,\" indicating positivity. \n\nThen there's a conclusion that combines all these factors to point to a high-arousal, positive emotion, specifically happy.
