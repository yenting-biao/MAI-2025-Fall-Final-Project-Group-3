For example, words with positive connotations (e.g., \"I'm excited\") might indicate happiness, while words with negative connotations (e.g., \"I'm frustrated\") might indicate anger or sadness.\n2. **Intonation**: The speaker's tone of voice, pitch, and rhythm can also convey emotions. For example, a rising intonation might indicate a question or curiosity, while a falling intonation might indicate a statement or certainty.\n3. **Vocal expression**: The speaker's volume, pace, and pauses can also convey emotions. For example, a loud or rapid pace might indicate excitement or anger, while a soft or slow pace might indicate sadness or boredom.\n\nWithout analyzing the actual audio file, I can only provide general guidance.
