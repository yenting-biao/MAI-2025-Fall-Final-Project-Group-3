The speaker is seeking a human connection to address a perceived injustice or issue, indicating a sense of disconnection and dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs. The use of the phrase \"this is ridiculous\" suggests a strong emotional response to a situation that the speaker feels is illogical or unfair. The speaker's tone is urgent and demanding, implying a sense of urgency and a desire for immediate action.\n\nThe speaker's request for a phone number to speak to a human being suggests a desire for personalized attention and a more empathetic response. This implies that the speaker feels the current system or process is impersonal and ineffective, and they are seeking a more human touch to resolve their issue. The use of the phrase \"can you like talk to somebody\" also suggests a sense of desperation and a feeling of being stuck in a bureaucratic or automated system that is not designed to accommodate their needs.
