The air is filled with the soft hum of a TV or a radio in the background, providing a gentle, soothing background noise. The speaker, a middle-aged woman with a kind face, sits on a worn, plush couch, her eyes locked on the person she's addressing, a friend or family member, perhaps. The atmosphere is relaxed, with a sense of trust and understanding between them.\n\nThe friend, a bit more reserved, sits in an armchair across from her, their eyes cast downward, considering the question. They take a deep breath, and a hint of a smile plays on their lips as they respond, \"Well, I did.\" The speaker's eyes light up with a mixture of concern and curiosity, and she leans forward, her hands clasped together, eager to hear the details.
