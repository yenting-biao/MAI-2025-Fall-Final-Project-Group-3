She preferred the predictable rhythm of her work, the familiar faces at the local market, and the comforting weight of a book in her lap each evening. Surprises were unwelcome guests, and she had built walls of routine high enough to keep them out.\\n\\nThose walls were breached on a Tuesday by a single, thick, cream-colored envelope that arrived in the mail.

It was addressed to her in a swirling, archaic script that spoke of generations of wealth and secrets.

The silence in her apartment seemed to deepen, amplifying the frantic beat of her own heart.
