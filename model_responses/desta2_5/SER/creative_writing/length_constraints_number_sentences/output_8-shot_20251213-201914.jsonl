This is conveyed through the speaker's steady and even-toned voice, which lacks any sense of urgency or emotion. The phrase itself, \\\"We'll stop in a couple of minutes,\\\" is a simple, direct statement of fact. Consequently, the audio feels like a routine announcement rather than a dramatic or emotional declaration. \", \"audios\": [{\"audio\": \"./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav\", \"text\": null}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Summarize the audio\u2019s main message in at least 3 complete sentences.\\n [ANS] The speaker in the audio clearly states their desire to obtain a new alarm clock.

This quality suggests the object could be made of a non-porous material like polished stone, glazed ceramic, glass, or a surface covered in a liquid like water or oil. The speaker's neutral, observational tone implies they are making a simple tactile or visual assessment of the object's texture. \", \"audios\": [{\"audio\": \"./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav\", \"text\": null}]}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Describe the speaker\u2019s tone in 4 sentences or more.\\n [ANS] Based on the audio clip, the speaker\u2019s tone is extremely high-pitched and frantic, bordering on a panicked shriek.
