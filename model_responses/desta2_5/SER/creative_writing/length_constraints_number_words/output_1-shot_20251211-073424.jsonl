Alex and Ben are in a living room or hallway, possibly near the entrance of the house. The atmosphere is calm, with a hint of nostalgia. The sound of the voice from the hallway is sudden and unexpected, causing Alex to react with surprise and Ben to respond with curiosity. The mention of Alex's grandma suggests a close family relationship, and the context implies that the two friends are engaging in a casual conversation, perhaps while waiting for someone to leave or preparing to leave themselves."}
