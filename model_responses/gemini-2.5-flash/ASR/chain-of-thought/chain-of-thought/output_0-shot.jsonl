This involves analyzing pitch, frequency, and duration.\n3.  **Pattern Matching:** These sound patterns are then matched against a vast database of known words and speech sounds in the English language.\n4.  **Language Model:** A language model is applied to predict the most likely sequence of words, considering grammar, context, and common linguistic patterns, to ensure accuracy and coherence.\n5.  **Text Output:** The system then converts this most probable sequence of words into the final written text."}
