My process needs to be precise. I need to be a careful listener, and I'll need to meticulously record every word. The audio begins with a delicate description, and that is what I will endeavor to capture perfectly.\n\nThe initial phrase speaks of a surgical delay. The fracture couldn't be addressed until 6:00 AM the following day, because a surgeon was unavailable beforehand. The speaker then paints a stark picture of the patient's current condition: at home, in a very uncertain and precarious state. This is clearly a critical situation, so capturing every nuance of the speech is very important.\n\n</thinking_summary>\nUnfortunately, the fracture could not be set till 6 o'clock the next morning, as no surgeon was to be had before that time. And she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the spoken transcription at the end of the model's response after the explanation block and removed the preceding meta-comments; I copied the continuous substring verbatim without any additions.\n\nResult: Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set till 6 o'clock the next morning, as no surgeon was to be had before that time.
