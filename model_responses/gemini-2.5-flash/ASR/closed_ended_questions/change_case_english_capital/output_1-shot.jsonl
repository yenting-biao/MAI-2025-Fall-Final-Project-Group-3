My primary objective is clear: I need to generate an output that *exactly* reflects the spoken words. I understand the importance of accuracy in transcription, and I'll make sure to get this right. The key here is the output format. The instructions are very specific - I *must* output the transcription entirely in capital letters. No exceptions, no variations. This is a crucial constraint that I will absolutely adhere to. I'll make sure to double-check before confirming the final output.
