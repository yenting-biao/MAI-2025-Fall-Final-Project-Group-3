I've been given an audio sample and the objective is clear: create a precise transcription. My expertise lies in accurately capturing the spoken word in its written form, and in this case, the client has emphasized a very specific requirement for the output format. I need to make sure I deliver it exactly as requested. No nuances, no interpretation, just the raw text of the audio. Considering the context, I understand that any deviation could render this transcript useless, so I must stay true to this instruction. I will listen to the audio carefully, and then I will reproduce every word exactly as I hear it, and I am to ensure that the final result is presented entirely in uppercase letters.\n", "response": "[ANS] WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL", "wer": 0.125, "exact_match": false, "answer_correct": false}
