No shortcuts here; absolute fidelity to the source material is the goal.\n\nBeyond capturing the words, there's a stylistic constraint. The output *must* be rendered entirely in uppercase letters. That's a formatting requirement, but it’s still important. So, after the initial transcription, I'll need to apply a transformation to ensure everything meets that specific uppercase criterion.
