No need for fancy formatting or analysis beyond that; it's a straightforward transcription request with a stylistic constraint. I've got the audio data, I know the target format, and I just need to perform the transcription, ensuring everything is lowercase. No punctuation is required. The key is in the formatting.\n", "response": " [ANS] mary taylor however related the tale of zoa to mrs gray's private ear later"}
