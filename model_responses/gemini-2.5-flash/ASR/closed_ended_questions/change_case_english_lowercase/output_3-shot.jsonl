I need to take this audio and produce a text transcript. The crucial aspect, from a formatting perspective, is that the entire output needs to be lowercase. That means I need to ignore standard capitalization rules. The actual audio content itself, while interesting, isn't complex. I'm looking for a direct transcription \u2013 no interpretation, summarization, or other modifications are needed. The source audio is \"mary taylor however related the tale of zoa to mrs grey's private ear later\". And the desired output is \"mary taylor however related the tale of zoa to mrs grey's private ear later\". Done.\n", "response": "mary taylor however related the tale of zoa to mrs grey's private ear later"}
