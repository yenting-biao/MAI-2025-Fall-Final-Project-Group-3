Once I have the audio loaded, my primary task will be to listen to it meticulously. As I listen, I'll type out the words being spoken, essentially performing a standard transcription. The key element, and the user's specific requirement, is that *every* letter of *every* word must be rendered in lowercase. This means I'll need to actively override any automatic capitalization that might occur due to typical English grammar rules (e.g., proper nouns, sentence beginnings). The output will be a plain text transcription, with no formatting beyond the lowercase text itself. I'll focus purely on accuracy in capturing the spoken words while strictly adhering to the lowercase format.\n", "response": " [ANS] now the object of this soliloquy is plain"}
