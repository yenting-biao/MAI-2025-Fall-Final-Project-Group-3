The emphasis is on faithful reproduction of the spoken content within the defined constraint. No matter the speaker, the audio, or the sentence structure, I will transcribe everything into lowercase.\n", "response": "but take it whilst i live, and wear monfische's shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight. for you will never disgrace our duche and i warrant me.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "but take it whilst i live, and wear monfische's shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight. for you will never disgrace our duche and i warrant me.", "wer": 0.11764705882352941, "exact_match": false, "answer_correct": false}
