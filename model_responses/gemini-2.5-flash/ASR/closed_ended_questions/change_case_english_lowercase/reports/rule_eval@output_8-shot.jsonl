That's straightforward enough. My task is to listen carefully to the audio and type out *exactly* what I hear. The crucial point here is the lowercase requirement; I need to ensure every single letter is in lowercase. No exceptions, no capitalization, even for proper nouns or the beginnings of sentences. I need to be meticulous about that aspect, because that's the core of what the user is asking for. It's a simple request, but attention to detail is paramount to meet the user's needs effectively. I will have to be very careful to maintain the lowercase.\n", "response": " [ANS] mary taylor however related the tale of zora to mrs gray's private ear later", "follow_instruction_list": [false], "follow_all_instructions": false, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [false], "strict_follow_all_instructions": false, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [false], "loose_follow_all_instructions": false, "response_for_scoring": "mary taylor however related the tale of zora to mrs gray's private ear later", "wer": 0.14285714285714285, "exact_match": false, "answer_correct": false}
