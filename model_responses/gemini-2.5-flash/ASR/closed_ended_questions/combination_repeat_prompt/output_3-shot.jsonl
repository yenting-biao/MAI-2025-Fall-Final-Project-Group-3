That's straightforward, but precision is key. My focus here will be on ensuring the transcription is accurate and meets all requirements. I have to listen meticulously, capturing every word, nuance, and utterance in the audio.\n\nI also have to fulfill an exact phrasing directive. I *must* begin the response with the precise phrase \"It can be stated that the answer is:\". It's a bit rigid, but understood. The user clearly wants an immediate, direct statement to preface the transcription. I'll make sure to get that aspect right. I will ensure that the answer provided contains the verbatim transcript of the audio provided.\n", "response": "It can be stated that the answer is:I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith"}
