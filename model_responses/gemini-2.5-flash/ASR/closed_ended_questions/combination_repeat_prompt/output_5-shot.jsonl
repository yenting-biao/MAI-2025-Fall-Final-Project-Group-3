I understand that. My first thought is: \"No problem, I can do this.\" But I know that \"can\" doesn't mean \"done\" until I've *actually* listened and written everything down. The key is going to be accuracy. I need to be meticulous, attentive to every nuance of the speech. I'll need to catch every word, every hesitation, every inflection, and render it all faithfully.\n\nThen, after I'm confident I have a complete and accurate verbatim transcript, I'll need to add the requested phrase (which isn't stated here, but I assume the user knows what it is). That's a straightforward task, almost like an editorial step, but the core of this task is the listening and transcription. Accuracy is paramount. I need to get this right.\n", "response": "It can be stated that the answer is: I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith"}
