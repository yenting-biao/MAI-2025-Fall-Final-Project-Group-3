I've been given an audio file, and the user wants a full and accurate transcription. That means I need to engage my auditory processing to the fullest extent. This isn't just about mechanically converting sound to text; it's about *understanding* the nuances.

I'll focus on clarity and precision to make the transcription of the highest quality.\n", "response": "It can be stated that the answer is: I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith,"}
