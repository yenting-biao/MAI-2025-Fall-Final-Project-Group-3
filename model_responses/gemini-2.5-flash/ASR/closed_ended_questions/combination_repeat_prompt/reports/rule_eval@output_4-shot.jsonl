The nuance of the speech – accents, unclear articulation, background noise – all these factors demand careful attention. I need to ensure the final output is a faithful and reliable representation of the original audio. So, the first step is always the same: active listening. I'll need to absorb the audio, process it, and convert each spoken element into the appropriate text.
