The core goal here is accurate transcription. I need to treat this audio as a signal, and my output should represent the data within that signal. My focus will be on the fidelity of the transcription, capturing the essence of the audio in its written form.\n\nI have been instructed to transcribe the audio content, and my response *must* begin with the phrase \"It can be stated that the answer is:\". It's a key to identifying the transcript for downstream processes. The content that follows that phrase should be a direct mapping of the spoken words in the audio file.
