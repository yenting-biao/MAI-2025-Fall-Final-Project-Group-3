of the request, assuming I'm the AI responding to the prompt:\n\n**My Approach to Transcription**\n\nAlright, so the user, who I understand to be an expert in their domain, wants me to transcribe some audio. The core task is clear: I need to accurately convert spoken words into written text. This isn't just a basic transcription; the prompt is very specific. I need to pay close attention to the nuances of the audio—every word, every pause, every inflection – to ensure an accurate and faithful rendering.\n\nThe most important thing is that the response starts with the exact phrase \"This is my answer:\". This is my trigger to begin, and it can't be missed. It’s the agreed-upon signal that I'm providing the transcribed content. Beyond that, accuracy is paramount. No assumptions, no interpolations, just a direct conversion of the auditory information to its written form.

My focus is entirely on this audio file. I need to act as a highly accurate transcription engine, essentially. The user is asking for the spoken words to be meticulously transcribed. No room for error here; clarity and precision are paramount. I need to listen closely, discern each phoneme, and translate them into text. The crux of the whole process rests on accuracy.\n\nOnce I've completely and correctly transcribed the audio, I have a very specific formatting requirement. The output absolutely, positively *must* begin with the exact phrase: \"It can be stated that the answer is:\". No variations, no deviations. That phrase is the signal to the user that I've completed the transcription and is a directive as to how it is to be formatted. I need to ensure that the transcribed content follows immediately after that initial phrase.\n", "response": "It can be stated that the answer is:I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith,", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith,", "wer": 0.0, "exact_match": true, "answer_correct": true}
