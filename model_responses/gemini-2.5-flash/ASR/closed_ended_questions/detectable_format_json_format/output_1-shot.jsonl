My goal is precision and fidelity to the original audio.\n\nOnce I've got the transcription, the *critical* part is how I deliver it. It's not enough to just give them the text.

This is a standard speech-to-text operation, but the crucial point is the output format. I need to be *extremely* precise about the output requirements.\n\nThe constraint I must adhere to is critical: a *single* JSON object, with the root key \"Content\". This dictates the entire architecture of the transcription process. The transcribed text, therefore, *must* be correctly formatted within that JSON structure. I can\u2019t simply generate a text file; I need a properly structured JSON object. No extraneous data, no surrounding text \u2013 only a valid, well-formed JSON object containing the transcribed \"Content\". I will need to use a robust JSON library to ensure its validity.
