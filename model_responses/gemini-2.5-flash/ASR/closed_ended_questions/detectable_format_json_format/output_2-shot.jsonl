I need to deliver a JSON object with the transcription under a 'Content' key. Let's get started.\n\nFirst listen: Hmm, sounds a bit garbled. \"I had a notion it was you may to see me from the next.\" That's not quite right. Let me re-listen and try to get a better grasp. Okay, I think it's \"I had a notion it was you mate, I see me from the next\" but that feels off too. Let's re-listen with focus on accuracy.\n\nAlright, sounds more like \"I had a notion it was you, mate, I'd say me from the next\" and \"next\" is what the last word is more likely to be.\n\nLet me try again, focusing on accuracy, \"I had a notion it was you, mate, I'd see me from the next.\" I can hear some ambiguity there at the end. It's difficult to parse that final word.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the ending. Now, if I break it down, \"I had a notion it was you, mate. I'd see me from the next.\" and I consider \"I'd say me from the nest\" or \"I'd see me from the nest\". The quality being what it is, \"I'd see me from the next\" seems like a reasonable interpretation. Let's work with that for now.\n\nConsidering my expertise, the word after \"from the\" is unclear. It could be \"nest\", \"next\", or something else altogether. Let's consider alternatives like, \"I had a notion it was you, mate, I'd see me from the first.\" or \"I had a notion it was you, mate, I'd see me from the last.\" Those don't work.\n\nAlright, let's focus on the end again: \"me from the\" ... and then something that sounds like \"nest\" or \"next.\" The first part is clear, thankfully: \"I had a notion it was you, mate,\". Then it's \"I'd see me from the...\" The final word is ambiguous. \"nest\" seems ever so slightly more likely than \"next\" given the sound, even though contextually \"next\" might fit better if it's a part of a longer phrase.\n\nOkay, let's try one more time, and really listen to that last word. It's tough. \"me from the\" ... \"nest\" or \"next\". I think I can hear an 's' sound at the end, so \"nest\" is probably the strongest candidate based on the sound itself. I'll go with: \"I had a notion it was you, mate, I'd see me from the nest.\"\n\nFinal check: \"I had a notion it was you, mate, I'd see me from the nest.\" That seems to be the best approximation I can make, given the limitations of the audio.
