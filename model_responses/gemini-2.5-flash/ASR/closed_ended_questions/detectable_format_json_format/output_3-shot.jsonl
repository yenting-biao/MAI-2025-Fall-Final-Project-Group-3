It's crucial I get this formatting right; the user will presumably be integrating this data into their workflow, and the JSON format is likely crucial for parsing. So, I need to make sure the end-result is not just the transcript, but also a valid JSON object. I'll need to double-check my output to ensure the JSON is valid. The examples they provided will act as my guide for the specific JSON format.\n", "response": "{\"Content\": \"He stood a moment bewildered, then turned and rushed upon the island.
