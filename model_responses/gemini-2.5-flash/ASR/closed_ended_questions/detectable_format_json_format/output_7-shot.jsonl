I've got audio to process, and the core goal is clear: I need to translate the spoken content into a written transcript. No problem there. The important thing is maintaining high accuracy and attention to detail during the listening phase. \n\nOnce I've accurately captured the spoken words, the real skill comes in. I'm going to structure the entire output as a JSON object. The formatting needs to be impeccable, with the transcribed text nestled under a key called 'Content'. This is standard practice, and keeping things clean and well-defined makes this process repeatable and the output usable in other downstream applications. It's really the only valid way to handle this, in my opinion. So, listen carefully, transcribe accurately, format correctly.
