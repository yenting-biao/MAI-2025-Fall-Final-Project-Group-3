My approach here is straightforward and leverages my core competency: I'll carefully listen to the provided audio. I'll meticulously transcribe every spoken word, ensuring accuracy and attention to detail. Once the transcription is complete, I'll package the entire output neatly within `<< >>` delimiters. This will clearly demarcate the finished product and allow for easy processing by the user. I'm going to aim for flawless accuracy, knowing they'll be relying on the transcription for analysis or further use.\n", "response": "<<Oh, 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, and my great mind most kingly drinks it up.
