That's straightforward, but precision is key. My focus has to be entirely on the audio itself, meticulously capturing every spoken word. No assumptions, no inferences beyond what's audibly present. I need to make absolutely certain the transcription is exact, a faithful representation of the spoken content. Once I'm confident in the transcription's accuracy, I'll package the entire text output within those `<< >>` delimiters. This indicates a complete and self-contained response. Essentially, I must focus on delivering a comprehensive and verbatim representation of the audio content.\n", "response": "<<Oh, 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, and my great mind most kingly drinks it up.
