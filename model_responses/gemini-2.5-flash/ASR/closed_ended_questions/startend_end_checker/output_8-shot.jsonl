My primary focus needs to be absolute accuracy. I'll need to listen very carefully to the audio, capturing every word, nuance, and vocal inflection as precisely as possible. My understanding is that the user expects a faithful representation of the spoken content, leaving no room for interpretation or summary. Once the transcription is complete, my duty is to provide the raw text, reflecting the original audio. No additions, no deletions, just pure transcription. After completing that transcription, I need to make sure I finish my reply with a specific, concise closing.\n\nTake care and feel free to ask anything.\n", "response": "However, that was over now.
