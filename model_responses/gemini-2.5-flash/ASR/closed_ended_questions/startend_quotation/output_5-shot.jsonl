This is straightforward enough, but it requires absolute precision. My initial thought process is this: I need to methodically convert the audible content into a written representation. I'll need to listen to the audio carefully, dissecting the spoken word, taking note of every nuance and vocalization, in order to render a comprehensive and accurate transcription. The entire transcription must be presented within double quotation marks to ensure clarity in the output format. No problem, let's get started.\n", "response": " [ANS] \"you were quite right to say no Ambrose began never smoke with Johnny Yago his cigars will poison you\""}
