The core of the issue revolves around a delay in medical intervention due to the unavailability of a specific medical professional. My initial thought is to break down the key phrases and then rebuild them with different terminology.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"the [fracture] could not be set.\" I need to rephrase the idea of a broken bone needing treatment. Terms like \"bone injury,\" \"bone repair,\" \"realignment of the injury,\" or \"treatment of the break\" are good options. The goal is to convey the need for a specific procedure to correct the issue.\n\nNext, I have to reword \"no [surgeon] was to be had.\" This is about the lack of a specific medical professional specializing in operations or more complex medical interventions. Therefore, I can substitute this with phrases such as \"medical professional,\" \"specialist doctor,\" \"medical expert,\" \"one qualified to perform the necessary procedure,\" or \"specialized medical practitioner\".\n\nLet's start putting the pieces together. My first attempt was: \"Unfortunately, the bone injury could not be treated until 6:00 the following morning, as no medical specialist was available before then. She is currently at her home in a very precarious and critical condition.\" Not bad, but I can probably refine it.\n\nThinking about alternatives, \"set\" has the sense of immediate action. Perhaps something like \"realigned\" or \"receive treatment\" might fit better. And \"doubtful and dangerous\" is a little too vague for my expertise. I should communicate the gravity of the situation more precisely.\n\nHere's my final iteration: \"Unfortunately, the bone injury could not be realigned until 6:00 AM the following day, because no medical expert capable of performing the procedure was available before then. She is currently at her residence in a very uncertain and critical condition.\" This accurately conveys the delay in treatment and the patient's precarious state, adhering to the specified word exclusions. The language is precise, avoids medical jargon, and maintains an appropriate tone for a description that needs to be understood.\n", "response": " [ANS] Unfortunately, the bone injury could not be treated until 6:00 AM the following day, as no medical professional qualified to perform the necessary procedure was available before then.

The \"compared with the owls, hawks and eagles\" needs to be handled delicately.

The task is to capture the movement within the scene, and importantly, to steer clear of certain words—specifically \"tent\" and \"squire\". It looks like the original audio described the retreat of an individual, and I have to explain that movement. The key is in the phrasing.\n\nFirst, I need to interpret the initial action: \"He gave way to the others very readily.\" This clearly means he yielded, stepped aside, or made room for them. Then, the audio goes on to say he \"retreated unperceived.\" He moved back, but covertly, so the other people in the scene wouldn't notice. I also have to note who these people are, which is where things get tricky, but the audio confirms \"mistress Fitz-eusth and the other person\". Finally, his destination is described as being \"to the rear of the structure.\"\n\nSo, I need to convey these elements without using the forbidden words. To build a solid description I considered multiple phrases:\n\n\"He moved aside for the others with ease, then subtly withdrew to the back of the pavilion, unobserved by his male companion and mistress Fitz-eusth.\"\n\n\"He yielded readily to the others, then discreetly withdrew to the rear of the canvas shelter, unseen by his male companion and mistress Fitz-eusth.\"\n\n\"The individual yielded their position to others quickly. They then moved backwards, unnoticed by the other gentleman and mistress Fitz-eusth, towards the rear of the temporary shelter.\"\n\nThese phrases focus on the yielding, the subtle withdrawal, and the lack of observation. I think these are effective ways to accurately convey the movement while adhering to the given constraints. I've re-listened to the audio, and the instructions are very clear about avoiding the words \"tent\" and \"squire\". The description successfully captures the flow of the movement in the scene and is fully compliant.\n", "response": " [ANS] The individual moved aside readily for the others, then subtly withdrew backward without being noticed by the other gentleman and mistress Fitz-eusth, heading towards the rear of the canvas enclosure.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true}

I need to capture the essence of being enveloped by a misty, liquid-like substance.\n\nFirst, I explored potential substitutes for \"water-veiled.\" The key here is to capture that sense of coverage and the watery quality. I considered phrases like \"covered by a liquid-like shroud,\" \"shrouded in a damp, hazy atmosphere,\" and \"cloaked in a humid, nebulous curtain.\" I experimented with combining these descriptions with \"mists,\" but many felt redundant or clunky, like \"nebulous curtain of mists.\" I thought about the core concepts.\n\nThe word \"veiled\" implies being covered or obscured. \"Water-veiled,\" then, means veiled *by something watery*. The task is to express that \"watery\" quality without the word itself.\n\nI considered a few attempts. I thought about \"The world was softly draped in damp mists,\" but it felt a bit too simple. I experimented with \"The world was shrouded in mists, which hung like a damp, ethereal curtain\" and \"The world was cloaked in mists, imbued with a soft, moist quality\" and \"The world was obscured by mists, which gave it a damp, hazy shroud.\" The challenge is to combine the \"veiled\" quality of \"water-veiled\" with the presence of mists.\n\nFinally, I hit upon the idea of directly replacing \"water-\" with a description of its essence. \"Heavy with moisture\" seemed promising.

Specifically, no mention of \"comedy\" or \"illusion\" is permitted. I see the provided text describes a theatrical experience. It mentions a woman playing the character of Mary Ann in a work by Marivaux. It's also critical to convey that, despite her age and declining health, her performance was incredibly convincing. I need to rephrase certain phrases.\n\nLet's break it down. The audio suggests: the performer played Mary Ann. The play was written by Marivaux. The performance happened close to her death. And, crucially, her age and health were relevant to the overall impression, but not the determining factor of her ability. The performance was \"complete\", that's the key idea.\n\nHere's my attempt: \"Two years before her death, I saw her perform the character of Mary Ann in the play by Marivaux. And in spite of her age and declining health, the portrayal was complete.\" I believe this captures the essence. \"Play\" works as a good replacement for the original phrasing as \"the comedy of Marivaux\" is a play, technically, a theatrical work and \"portrayal was complete\" replaces the original phrase effectively communicating the same meaning. This avoids the forbidden words and accurately conveys the core idea of a powerful and successful performance despite the circumstances. I think this works perfectly.\n", "response": " [ANS] Two years before her death, the speaker saw her perform the character of Mary Ann in the play by Marivaux.

Instead of \"wife,\" I could say: \"female partner,\" \"female spouse,\" \"female member of the household,\" \"female individual in the relationship,\" or simply \"the woman in the household.\" The key is to capture the *role*, not the label.\n\nOkay, let's rephrase: \"But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the female partner alone.\" Or perhaps, \"upon the woman in the household alone.\" That feels better.\n\nThe core idea is this: As social standing decreases, the *sole responsibility* for demonstrating \"vicarious leisure and consumption\" is placed on a *single female member* of the household. This points to a gendered and class-based division of labor when displaying status.\n\nNow, let's craft the social commentary. I can describe the speaker's observation this way: They're pointing out a societal phenomenon where, as you move down the social ladder, the entire weight of embodying and performing \"vicarious leisure and consumption\" shifts onto the *female individual within the household*. The phrase “vicarious leisure and consumption” suggests that someone is displaying wealth or status through others, but the interesting part is this *concentration* of the burden. It indicates a societal expectation for women to somehow represent affluence or status, even when the resources are scarce, and this expectation appears to intensify at lower social levels. It suggests a very specific pressure on a certain demographic.\n\nRight, I've got it. I'll focus on the shift in responsibility and the specific person who bears that burden, carefully avoiding the forbidden term.\n", "response": " [ANS] The social commentary highlights a shift as one descends the social scale: the responsibility for demonstrating vicarious leisure and consumption becomes singularly imposed upon the female member of the household. This suggests that in certain social strata, the obligation to perform these duties falls exclusively on the woman in the relationship.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true}

The audio sample provides \"My bed was unexceptionably comfortable\" as the baseline. My first job is to deconstruct \"unexceptionably comfortable.\"\n\n\"Unexceptionably\" screams \"exceptionally\" or \"remarkably\" comfortable. It's beyond just \"comfortable\"; it's a level of ease that exceeds what's expected. I need to find synonyms that capture that *exceptional* quality. I know I can replace comfortable with words like cozy, plush, soft, inviting, relaxing, snug, or restful, but I have to maintain the level of the *unexceptionable* element.\n\nI started by looking at combinations, like \"remarkably cozy,\" but that felt a little flat. I thought about phrasing it as a specific *item* – \"The item provided an extraordinary level of comfort\" or \"The sleeping surface was supremely comfortable.\" I rejected \"sleeping surface\" because it's still too direct. I’m thinking, something more indirect, more evocative.\n\nThe goal is to provide a description, rather than directly stating what the object is. I considered phrases like, \"The place for rest\" but I wasn't happy with it. It needed a more polished delivery. \"It provided an uncommonly comfortable experience\" – that could work. Also, \"The resting spot was exceedingly comfortable.\"\n\nI wanted to capture the essence of \"unexceptionably.\" This is the core of the challenge. I need to convey both the comfort *and* that it’s unusual. \"The item was exceptionally comfortable, providing a superior level of ease.\" That's close. I also considered \"the level of comfort provided was truly exceptional, exceeding all expectations.\" \"The item offered a remarkable degree of comfort, making it supremely cozy.\" I like that: \"remarkable degree\" for \"unexceptionably\" and \"supremely cozy\" for comfort.\n\nI landed on this: \"The item offered a remarkable degree of comfort, making it supremely cozy and inviting.\" It's concise, captures the level of comfort, and the implication of rest, without being too explicit. I could also use \"The comfort level of the item was remarkable, proving to be supremely cozy.\"\n\nUltimately, my best option is: \"The item offered a remarkable degree of comfort, making it supremely cozy and inviting.\" It is the clearest way to convey the message, the most concise, and the most engaging.

The audio states that Philip is honest, and he has enough talent to succeed, *if* he stops \"scribbling.\" So, his potential is clearly tied to ceasing this specific action, whatever it is.\n\nThe core of the issue seems to be that he has the raw materials - honesty and talent - but something is holding him back from reaching his full potential. \"Scribbling,\" in this context, implies an unproductive or unfocused activity. It could be aimless drawing, unproductive artistic endeavors, or simply wasting time on things that don't contribute to progress. The key is that it's hindering his ability to \"make his way,\" which I interpret as achieving success or making progress toward his goals.\n\nSo, how can I rephrase this effectively?

I considered several options: \"aimless drawing,\" \"unproductive artistic activities,\" \"idle marks,\" and \"unfocused work.\" Ultimately, I think the best way to capture the essence of the problem is to use a more general term that encompasses all of these: **\"unfocused efforts.\"** This allows for flexibility in interpretation, leaving open the possibility that the \"scribbling\" is not specifically artistic, but any pursuit that is not productive.\n\nTherefore, my final assessment is this: **Philip is honest and has sufficient talent to achieve success if he focuses his efforts.** This summary directly conveys the essence of the audio without using the problematic word, highlighting his positive qualities and identifying the critical condition for him to achieve his potential.

The audio states, \"...he perceived the *key* which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.\" The core error here is the servant's negligence, resulting in something being left where it shouldn't be. The focus should be on the act of leaving and the carelessness, not the specific object itself. I need to distill this down to the essence of the mistake.\n\nInitially, I considered options like \"The servant carelessly left an important item,\" or variations that emphasized an \"object being left behind\". I then refined my thinking by attempting a rephrase: \"The servant's carelessness led to an object being left in an exposed position,\" or \"The servant, due to carelessness, left an item accessible.\" My goal is to capture the negligence and the act of leaving without direct reference to a \"key\". I want the summary to focus on the action, or the negligence in doing so.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the clearer the central point became: the *servant's* action. The mistake lies in their carelessness, leading to something being left unsecured. This is the root of the problem.\n\nSo, after considering a few options, I can formulate the summary as \"The servant's carelessness of leaving an item unsecured\". This concisely captures the mistake. It correctly identifies the source of the mistake, the servant, the quality of said mistake, the carelessness, and the effect of the mistake, something was left unsecured.\n", "response": " [ANS] The servant's carelessness led to an item being left unsecured.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true}

This is an interesting challenge because those words, while direct, are evocative. I need to maintain the same emotional weight and core meaning, but with different terminology.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the speaker is *really* trying to say. \"Rust\" is clearly a metaphor – it means decline, inactivity, the loss of potential. So, I need to find synonyms like \"deteriorate,\" \"stagnate,\" or \"become inactive.\" The phrase \"be stupid\" suggests a criticism of intellect or decision-making. \"Unwise,\" \"unthinking,\" or \"foolish\" are options.\n\nThe final part, \"sit in an action because I am a girl,\" makes the core of the complaint clear: it is about gender-based limitations. It is about forced passivity and the denial of agency. So, I need to convey that she is being *compelled* to be inactive and potentially, unwise.\n\nNow to synthesize this. She is questioning why she is being *forced* into a state of *inaction*, potentially *unwise* choices, and limited roles. She's expressing frustration about gender-based limitations.\n\nI'll formulate a few options, keeping them natural sounding. Perhaps: \"She's questioning why she should become stagnant and act foolishly, accepting a passive role simply because she is a girl.\" This seems most effective. \"Stagnant\" hits the \"rust\" point, \"act foolishly\" captures the \"be stupid\" part, and \"accepting a passive role\" captures the \"sit in an action\" section. It all hangs together and maintains the important bit, \"simply because she is a girl\".\n\nThis version avoids both prohibited words, I think it captures all the nuances, and the emotion of the original. The meaning should still be clear to the listener.

Alright, how about \"If addressed, she would remain silent\"? It's straightforward. Or, \"She wouldn't utter a sound if engaged in conversation.\" Still a bit bland. \"Even if someone initiated a conversation, she wouldn't make a sound.\" I'm getting there. \"She would offer no verbal response if someone tried to talk to her.\"\n\nThe original implies a *continuation* of silence, \"she would not speak *again*.\" That means the silence isn't just an initial reaction; it persists, even after the interaction is started. I need to express a continuous absence of verbal communication.\n\nOkay, let's see... \"If addressed, she would not offer any verbal response.\" It works, but it feels a bit clunky. \"If conversed with, she would not respond verbally.\" Getting warmer. Hmm... \"Should someone attempt to communicate with her, she would remain utterly silent.\" Yes, that captures it. The \"utterly silent\" emphasizes the complete lack of sound.

The speaker *isn't* on the \"cart\" (whatever that is) right now, but they *want* to be. This suggests a desire for a change in state or location. The key here is to determine what \"on the cart\" means without using the word.\n\nMy mind immediately leaps to the idea of a vehicle, something that facilitates movement or transport. But, \"cart\" can have several connotations – a shopping \"cart,\" a horse-\"cart,\" or even a more metaphorical usage. Given the phrase's structure, I think the *process* of being transported is central, the idea of being moved toward something.\n\nI start to brainstorm possible paraphrases. \"In motion\" feels like a good, general alternative. \"In transit\" also works, suggesting being en route. However, I want to capture the sense of *being carried* or *moved along*. Therefore, the phrase is a longing to be further along in a process.\n\nUltimately, I want the summary to highlight this desire for progress. Therefore, I'll go with a concise and direct description. The speaker expresses a desire to already be in motion, highlighting the desired state of advancement or travel.

The original statement is something like, \"Did not Christ himself say, I am the way and the truth and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me?\" My task is to avoid \"Christ\" and \"truth.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The first part, the introduction, needs a substitute for \"Christ\". \"Son of God\" seems a valid and accepted replacement, so that will work. \"Did not the Son of God himself declare\" keeps the introductory feel. Alternatively, \"Was it not proclaimed by him\" is another option to keep in mind, in case the original phrasing is too clunky.\n\nThe core of the statement, \"I am the way and the truth and the life,\" needs some careful consideration. \"Truth\" is the key issue. \"Reality\" feels like a direct and suitable substitute here. It retains the sense of ultimate fact, which is what's being conveyed, I think. So \"I am the way, the reality, and the life\" seems a natural fit.\n\nFinally, the concluding portion, \"no man cometh unto the Father but by me,\" needs to be reworded. \"No one comes to the Father except through me\" is a clear and direct paraphrase that works well. \"No individual approaches the Father apart from my guidance\" is another alternative.\n\nPutting it together, I like the way it flows as \"Did not the Son of God himself say, 'I am the way, the reality, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me'?\" This avoids the forbidden words. \"Son of God\" replaces \"Christ\" without a loss of meaning, and \"reality\" is a good substitution for \"truth\" in this context. It's concise and maintains the original intent.

The character's pondering on this subject indicates that there is some significance to this idea.

I gravitated towards \"choosing the candidate\" because it’s direct, concise, and avoids potential ambiguity.\n\nThen, I considered more abstract options to keep the rephrasing more general, like \"selection of the individual\" or \"support the gentleman's bid for office.\" These work but are perhaps a bit too verbose for the constraint.\n\nUltimately, I focused on brevity and clarity and landed on a more concise version that satisfies the restrictions: \"The women were flattered by the young lady's attention and had promised to assist in the selection of the individual.\" This replaces \"electing\" with \"selection of\" and \"Mr. Forbes\" with \"the individual\" while maintaining the essential meaning.

My initial thought process revolves around carefully dissecting the provided phrases and extracting relevant personality traits. \"Good appetite\" is a physical detail, but it speaks to a certain zest for life. \"Could tell a good story without laughing\" implies self-control, poise, and potentially a dry sense of humor. The description of \"witty repartees and sociable manners\" is straightforward – the individual is clearly charismatic and good with people, or *was* at least.\n\nHowever, the contrast that \"he spent his life at home, seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone\" throws a wrench in the works.

I’m thinking in terms of how I'd phrase this to a colleague.\n\nFirst, I need to convey that the retreat *starts* on a particular day. The audio said \"Wednesday afternoon,\" and I have to translate that without using the word \"Wednesday.\" \"Midweek\" feels a little vague. The point is to replace \"Wednesday\" with another reference. \"The third day of the week\" works, but it's a bit clunky. How about \"the middle day of the week\"? That’s probably the clearest replacement, in terms of both meaning and conciseness.\n\nSecond, I need to address that the retreat is connected to St. Francis Xavier. The audio said “in honor of St Francis Xavier,\" I can leave that as is.\n\nThird, I need to figure out how to avoid \"feast day\". The audio stated, \"whose feast day is Saturday\". I can replace \"feast day\" with another suitable term. \"Day of observance\" is a possibility but feels a bit formal. \"Day of special commemoration\" works, but is a bit verbose. How about \"day of remembrance\"? It is concise and avoids \"feast day\".\n\nSo, let's combine these thoughts into a single, cohesive sentence. I'll need to make sure it's clear and efficient. I need to replace \"Wednesday\" and \"feast day\", and it needs to be precise.\n\nLet’s try a few different options:\n\n*   “The retreat will commence on the afternoon of the week's central day, honoring St. Francis Xavier, whose special day of remembrance is Saturday.” This seems good, hitting both the accuracy and brevity notes I'm aiming for.\n*   \"The retreat is set to begin on the afternoon of the middle day of the week, in honor of St. Francis Xavier, whose special day of commemoration is Saturday.\" Another good option.\n*   \"The retreat is slated to begin on the afternoon of the week's midpoint, dedicated to St. Francis Xavier, whose commemorative day is Saturday.\" I’m not sure about \"midpoint\" here. It *could* be interpreted differently.\n*   \"The retreat is scheduled to begin on the afternoon of the upcoming week's third day...\" No, that's getting verbose again.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"The retreat will commence on the afternoon of the week's central day, honoring St. Francis Xavier, whose special day of remembrance is Saturday.\" It's concise and precise, hitting all the requirements.

She's described as \"a clever, intelligent Yorkshire woman\" who runs a \"druggist shop in Haworth.\" From that, and her \"experience and excellent sense,\" she's the village's \"doctress and nurse.\" That immediately tells me she's not just a shopkeeper, but a vital part of the community's health and well-being. Furthermore, the audio emphasizes her role as a compassionate presence, being \"a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death.\" She's not just dispensing medicine; she's a support system. Then, there is also the story she told about Tabby's injured leg, which adds a personal touch to the narrative.\n\nNow, let's refine this to avoid those restricted terms. While she's described as \"a good neighbor of the family mentioned,\" the emphasis should be on her individual qualities and the functions she performs. \"A good neighbor\" is a general statement, so I'll leave it aside. For \"fractured leg,\" it's easy enough to substitute; \"broken leg\" will serve just as well.\n\nSynthesizing all of that, here's my interpretation: She’s an intelligent Yorkshire shopkeeper in Haworth, running a druggist's.

The request is to avoid \"evil\" and \"bewildered.\" That's the core of the problem. Essentially, the task demands that I convey negativity and a sense of disorientation in a more nuanced way.\n\nThe phrase \"evil influence\" presents a straightforward translation problem. \"Evil\" suggests a moral failing, a deliberate act of wrong-doing. I can address this with phrases like \"detrimental effect,\" \"harmful impact,\" or perhaps \"sinister hold,\" but I need to make the impact clear. I’m leaning towards \"detrimental effect\" as it clearly implies a negative consequence without specifically attributing it to a moral agent.\n\nThe \"bewildered condition\" is trickier. This suggests a state of mental disarray, of not knowing what to make of something. I could substitute it with \"confused state,\" \"perplexed mind,\" or \"disoriented state.\" I think \"state of confusion\" offers a good balance between clarity and precision, without leaning too hard into the dramatic or intense.\n\nThe rest of the sentence alludes to the speaker's internal questioning or doubt about the truth of something previously stated, which implies a state of doubt.\n\nPutting it all together, I’m thinking the best replacement is: \"The history of its detrimental effect resurfaced in my memory, and in my state of confusion, I began to question if there was some veracity in the assertions that had been made.\" This captures the negative impact and the internal struggle with the original audio’s sentiment, while adhering to the constraints.

My initial thought process is to dissect the key phrase: \"But take it whilst I live, and wear Montfichet's shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight.\"\n\nThe core of the action is the transfer of an item. The critical aspect is that the item represents a \"brave sight\" and is to be worn. I need to replace the specific term, and I've considered several options. \"Protective gear\" is too general. \"Defensive plate\" is a possibility. \"Emblazoned defense\" and \"heraldic device\" are more fitting, given the era. I've ruled out \"shield\" and the proper name, obviously.\n\nKnowing it's a significant object, possibly related to knighthood or honor, I can't just substitute anything. So, I need to convey both the protective function *and* the symbolic weight. Phrases like \"defensive emblem\" or \"noble protection\" might work well.\n\nConsidering the surrounding dialogue, specifically \"For you will never disgrace ours Dutch and I warrant me,\" it seems the gift is a symbol of trust and honour, intrinsically linking the giver and receiver. This adds another layer, because the item is not just for protection, but *for reputation*.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to formulate a summary like this: \"The speaker instructs the recipient to accept and wear the defensive emblem while the speaker is still alive. The item is meant to be worn on occasions that bring joy to the speaker, particularly when witnessing brave deeds. The speaker believes the recipient will never bring dishonor to their name by wearing it.\" This should cover all the necessary elements and meet the constraints.

The key here is to capture the essence of what's said without getting bogged down in specifics that might trigger the forbidden words.\n\nFirst, I identified the key pieces of information. Mary Taylor related a story to someone confidentially, later on. That's the framework. I broke it down: Mary Taylor, a tale (of something named... let's avoid the name!), and to a \"private ear\" later on. The \"private ear\" is crucial; it means a confidential telling.\n\nNow to rephrase. I can't say \"Zora\" or \"Gray,\" which means I need substitutes. \"The tale\" or \"the story\" can stand in for the subject, and for the recipient, I can't just use a pronoun – the audio specified \"Mrs. Gray.\" I need a neutral descriptor. \"The woman\" or \"the lady\" will work, and I will also need to rephrase \"private ear.\"\n\nMy first draft was too vague: \"Mary Taylor told a story to her private ear later.\" That's too simplistic. Then I went with \"Mary Taylor later recounted a story to a woman, in confidence.\" Better, but \"in confidence\" might be a bit too general, and \"later\" felt a bit disconnected.\n\nThe audio said \"...'s private ear\", implying a specific, confidential recipient. So I tried \"Mary Taylor later recounted the story to the lady confidentially.\" I'm getting closer, but \"lady\" seems a bit clunky.\n\nI kept refining, considering synonyms and word choices. I finally settled on: \"Mary Taylor, however, later shared the narrative privately with the woman.\" \"Narrative\" is a strong word to replace \"tale,\" and \"privately\" captures the confidentiality implied by \"private ear.\" It covers all aspects, respects the \"however,\" and steers clear of the forbidden words.
