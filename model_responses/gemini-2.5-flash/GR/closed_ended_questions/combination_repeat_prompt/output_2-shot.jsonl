Right, no problem. I've been through similar analyses before, so the process is familiar. First, I need to get the audio and give it a proper listen. Then, it's a matter of identifying those crucial acoustic cues. I'm focusing on pitch, definitely; that's usually the most salient indicator. But also, I'll pay close attention to any vocal characteristics that are typically associated with different genders \u2013 the resonances, the formants, those sorts of subtleties that build a sonic profile.
