First, I need to listen to the audio. I'll focus specifically on the vocal characteristics. Based on my expertise, I'll be listening for key indicators: the fundamental frequency (pitch), formant structure, and any subtle nuances that suggest typical gendered vocal anatomy. From the description, it seems the audio's speaker has a low pitch. Given my extensive training, I'll be able to quickly determine if this falls within a typical male vocal range. I'll need to confirm that this pitch, and any other indicators, align with the perception of a \"typical male voice\".
