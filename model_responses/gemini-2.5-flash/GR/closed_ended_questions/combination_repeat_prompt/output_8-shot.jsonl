Sounds straightforward enough, though I know how nuanced voice analysis can be, especially with potential distortions or recording quality issues. My process is clear: I'll listen to the audio carefully, focusing on those acoustic characteristics that differentiate male and female voices. Things like fundamental frequency (the perceived pitch), vocal tract length, formant structure, and even subtle prosodic features will be key indicators. I'll be listening for the core traits. Based on my analysis, I will confidently produce the final answer, in the required format. My initial impression is it sounds like a female voice.\n", "response": "It can be stated that the answer is: woman"}
