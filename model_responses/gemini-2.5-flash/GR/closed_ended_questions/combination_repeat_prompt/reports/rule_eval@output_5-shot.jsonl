It's a simple classification problem, really. I've been asked to listen to the audio and ascertain whether the voice leans towards male or female characteristics. Based on the instructions and the examples provided, I understand that the output format needs to be direct and precise; no room for ambiguity. I need to format my answer as \"It can be stated that the answer is: [gender]\".\n\nHaving examined the voice data, my analysis points towards a higher pitch and a timbre that aligns with the acoustic properties typically associated with a female voice. Therefore, I can make a judgement.\n", "response": "It can be stated that the answer is:woman", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "woman", "exact_match": true, "answer_correct": true}
