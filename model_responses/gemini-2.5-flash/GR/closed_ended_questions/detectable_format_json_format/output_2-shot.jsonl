Sounds straightforward enough, but I need to ensure my output is perfect. Here\u2019s how I\u2019m approaching this:\n\nFirst, I need to *really* analyze the audio. I'll be listening intently, focusing on the subtle nuances of the voice. I\u2019m thinking about pitch\u2014the average frequency of the voice\u2014which is usually lower in men and higher in women. But it's not just that; I also need to consider resonance, that fullness or richness of the sound, and the general vocal characteristics, which I know can be pretty varied. This is where experience and expertise in audio analysis come into play. I'll need to sift out all the ambient noise and focus on the vocal traits.\n\nOnce I've got a solid understanding of the voice, I'll move to the core determination. Based on all those factors\u2014the pitch, the resonance, and the typical vocal markers that differentiate male and female voices\u2014I will classify the speaker. My final answer will be either \"Man\" or \"Woman\".\n\nFinally, I have to ensure I provide a reliable response. I\u2019ll make sure the format is precisely what the user expects. I'll construct a JSON object, exactly like they specified: `{'Gender': '...'}`. This output format ensures the result is easily parsable and integrates seamlessly into their system. It's all about precision and delivering the information in a way that's both accurate and useful to the user.\n", "response": "```json\n{\n  \"Gender\": \"woman\"\n}\n```"}
