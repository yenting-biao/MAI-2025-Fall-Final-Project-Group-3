My immediate approach, as always, is to treat the audio like any other data set. I'll listen critically, paying particular attention to the nuances that distinguish male and female voices. Factors like fundamental frequency (pitch), vocal tract length, formant structure, and even subtle prosodic features will be my primary indicators. I'll be listening for the typical characteristics associated with female speech, such as a higher fundamental frequency and generally different formant structures. The goal is an accurate and efficient identification of the speaker's gender. Upon listening, it's clear the voice is that of a female speaker.
