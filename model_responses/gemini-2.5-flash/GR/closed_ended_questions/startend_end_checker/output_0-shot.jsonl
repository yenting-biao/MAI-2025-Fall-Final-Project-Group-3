It's ambiguous! Does it refer to the first speaker, the most prominent, or something else? Considering the restriction to a single choice, I have to make assumptions, or rather, pick a rule to follow.\n\nSince I don't have further context, I considered duration. The male voice speaks for a longer duration, ~4 seconds, compared to the female voice which is on the clip for ~1 second. I re-listened to confirm.\n\nGiven the phrasing and the forced single choice, I concluded I must pick one.
