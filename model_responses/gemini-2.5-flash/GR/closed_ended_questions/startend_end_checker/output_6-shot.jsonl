That's straightforward enough. My process is clear: I need to *listen* to the audio, focus on the vocal characteristics, and determine the gender of the speaker. It's a quick analysis based on years of identifying vocal patterns.\n\nOnce I've made that determination, the answer needs to be presented in a very specific format: `[ANS] <gender>`. Simple and direct.\n\nBased on what I've heard \u2013 which I've processed and found the vocal tones and characteristics, indicate a male speaker.\n\n[ANS] Man\n\nTake care and feel free to ask anything.\n", "response": " [ANS] man\nTake care and feel free to ask anything."}
