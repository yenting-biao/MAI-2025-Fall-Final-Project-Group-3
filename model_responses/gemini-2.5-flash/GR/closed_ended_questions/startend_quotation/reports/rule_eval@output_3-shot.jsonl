That's straightforward enough. My process will be: first, to actually *listen* to the audio. This is the crucial first step; you can't assess the voice without hearing it. Then, based on my understanding of vocal characteristics and how they correlate to gender, I need to make a judgment call: is it a male voice, or a female voice? I'll be listening for the typical acoustic cues – fundamental frequency, formant structure, vocal tract length, and any other nuances that indicate gender. Finally, once I'm confident in my assessment, I'll output the answer as a simple string, using the specified format. After listening, and taking into account all the features that contribute to the perception of a person being male or female, I have determined the voice sounds like a man.
