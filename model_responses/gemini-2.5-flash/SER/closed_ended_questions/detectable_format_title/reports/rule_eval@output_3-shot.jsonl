I'm focusing on those vocal cues: the slightly elevated pitch, that hint of a questioning, maybe exasperated tone. It's not a furious outburst, definitely not. It's more like a flicker of realization coupled with a touch of annoyance – almost as if the speaker just realized something that mildly irritated them, but not enough to be full-on angry.\n\nThen there's the phrase itself, \"Oh, so it isn't just my business.\" It's the *way* that's said – that \"Oh\" at the start, that inflection on \"just\".

I imagine the speaker is practically bubbling with enthusiasm. Then, we have the \"Hah\" at the end, which is more of a sigh or exhale. Considering the context, that's not a dismissive or negative sound. It's more of a relaxed, contented sigh after a positive thought. So overall, the speaker is experiencing joy and pleasure.

No problem, I can do this!\n\nLet's break down the vocal characteristics. The overall impression is one of subdued delivery. The tone isn’t particularly high-energy; it sounds low and almost deflated. The pitch seems to align with this, being relatively low rather than elevated. The speaking speed is also notably slow. This isn't someone rushing or enthusiastic. Then there is the volume. It's notably low. No booming pronouncements here. Lastly, there are several soft, almost hushed qualities to their delivery. Overall, the speaker sounds melancholic or distressed. There is an almost delicate or fragile nature to the vocal style.\n\nBased on this analysis, I have a clear sense.

Absolutely not. Sadness *might* be present, but the primary feeling seems to be something else. Now, anger - *that* fits.
