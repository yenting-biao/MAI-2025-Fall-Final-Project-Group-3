A continuation could be: Our confidence, or lack of confidence, in the accuracy of a memory image, must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image. This means that our subjective feeling of certainty about a memory isn't derived from a direct comparison with an objective past event. Instead, our confidence stems from the vividness, coherence, or emotional resonance of the memory's internal representation. For example, a highly detailed and emotionally charged memory often feels more reliable to us, even if its objective accuracy hasn't been independently verified. Therefore, understanding the nature of these internal memory characteristics is crucial for truly grasping how we perceive the reliability of our own recollections."}
