My mother, with her kind heart, couldn't bear to see them suffer. Despite the challenge of feeding so many extra mouths, she started leaving out food and water for them. We even built a makeshift shelter. It was a chaotic but heartwarming experience, trying to manage them all, especially with our own pets already in the house.
