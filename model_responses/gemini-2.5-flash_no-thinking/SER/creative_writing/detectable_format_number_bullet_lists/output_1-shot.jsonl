Practicing clear pronunciation and opening the mouth more when speaking would significantly improve how easily listeners can comprehend what is being said.\n*   **Increase Volume and Projection:** The speaker's voice is very quiet, almost a whisper, which makes it challenging to hear without straining. Working on projecting the voice more and speaking with greater volume would make the speech more accessible and engaging for an audience.\n*   **Engage with a More Assertive Tone:** The current tone sounds hesitant and unsure. Developing a more assertive and confident tone, even when asking a question, can make the speaker sound more impactful and ensure their words carry more weight."}
