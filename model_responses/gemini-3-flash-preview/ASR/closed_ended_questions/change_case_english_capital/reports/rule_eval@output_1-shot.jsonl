And she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.\"\n\nNow, let's make sure I'm adhering to the constraints. The instructions specifically say *only* uppercase text. So, I need to convert it all. I also need to verify that I have correctly transcribed everything. I am confident in the transcription.\n\nI'll double-check: \"Unfortunately the fracture cannot be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.\"\n\nHmm, I see I may have to adjust the formatting based on the example given to me. The example looks like this: \"[ANS] ...\". So, I should include that in my output.\n\nNow let's translate to only uppercase.\n[ANS] UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE CANNOT BE SET TILL 6:00 THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE.\n\nI realize that it's typical to write \"six o'clock\" out as words or digits.

So, my transcription is:\n\"Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning, as no surgeon was to be had before that time; and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.\"\n\nNow I must check the instructions: \"Transform the given audio message into text form.

I'll break the audio down to make sure I got it right:\n\n*   00:00 - 00:03: \"In a sunset glowing of crimson and gold...\"\n*   00:04 - 00:07: \"...she lies, the glory of the world,\"\n*   00:08 - 00:11: \"A beached king's galley whose sails are furled,\"\n*   00:11 - 00:14: \"who is hung with tapestries rich and old.\"\n\nThe combined text reads \"IN A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES, THE GLORY OF THE WORLD, A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SAILS ARE FURLED, WHO IS HUNG WITH TAPESTRIES RICH AND OLD.\"\n\nI need to confirm if there are any subtle pronunciation nuances. It sounds like \"whose sails are furled\" and \"who is hung with.\" Let me check that again.\n\nOkay, everything checks out: \"IN A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES, THE GLORY OF THE WORLD, A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SAILS ARE FURLED, WHO IS HUNG WITH TAPESTRIES RICH AND OLD.\"\n\nNow, let's look at how to format the output. The example has `[ANS]` followed by the text. So, I will follow that: `[ANS] IN A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES THE GLORY OF THE WORLD A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SAILS ARE FURLED WHO IS HUNG WITH TAPESTRIES RICH AND OLD`.\n\nI'll revisit the example to be certain. \"I think I have a doctor's appointment\" becomes \"[ANS] I THINK I HAVE A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT\".\n\nSo, I will format my output accordingly. Let's make sure I'm precise. Let's make sure I don't miss any words. Looking over the audio again, I confirm the text:\n* 00:00 In\n* 00:00 a\n* 00:01 sunset\n* 00:02 glowing\n* 00:02 of\n* 00:03 crimson\n* 00:03 and\n* 00:04 gold\n* 00:04 she\n* 00:05 lies,\n* 00:05 the\n* 00:06 glory\n* 00:06 of\n* 00:07 the\n* 00:07 world,\n* 00:08 a\n* 00:08 beached\n* 00:09 king's\n* 00:09 galley\n* 00:10 whose\n* 00:10 sails\n* 00:11 are\n* 00:11 furled,\n* 00:12 who\n* 00:12 is\n* 00:12 hung\n* 00:13 with\n* 00:13 tapestries\n* 00:14 rich\n* 00:14 and\n* 00:14 old.\n\nLet's do a final check for punctuation.
