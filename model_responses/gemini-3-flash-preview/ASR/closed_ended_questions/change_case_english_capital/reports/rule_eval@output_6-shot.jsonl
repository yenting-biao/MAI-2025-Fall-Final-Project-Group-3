Okay, so that resolves that minor ambiguity.\n\nNow, let's nail down the formatting. The instructions explicitly state to use *only* capital letters. Good. And the examples I have seen are consistent with the text I need. No punctuation is added at the end of the sentence or after names, despite the \"Mr.\"\n\nOkay, let's get this right. The pause is natural in speech and the names are capitalized.

The sentence is \"At the farther end of the largest hall, a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows.\"\n\nI checked other examples for style and punctuation. I see a pattern: previous examples don't include periods at the end or commas. Though, the audio sentence has a natural pause (comma) after \"hall\". I've decided to omit the punctuation to match the previous examples.\n\nI re-listened to the audio, and it is a perfect match. I considered whether to use \"farther\" or \"further,\" recognizing that \"farther\" is correct for physical distance. I did another check of the examples to confirm the formatting.\n\nFinally, I confirmed the words, capitalization, and punctuation, and settled on this response: AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS.\nI checked to make sure I wrote \"hall\" and not \"haul\".\nAnd just one more listen.\nAnd the response is: AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS\n\n\n", "response": " [ANS] AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS ", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS", "wer": 0.0, "exact_match": true, "answer_correct": true}
