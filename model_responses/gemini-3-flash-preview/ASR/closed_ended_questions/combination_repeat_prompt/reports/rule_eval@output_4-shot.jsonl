The objective here is straightforward: provide a verbatim transcription of the spoken content, and I need to adhere to a specific output format.\n\nMy thought process is this: First, let's break down the task. I need to identify the spoken sentence within the audio. Then, I need to execute the transcription step. The text that is spoken is \"Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.\" Finally, I need to assemble the transcribed text according to the requested format. It's crucial that I begin the response with the phrase \"This is my answer:\" and then present the transcribed sentence. Seems simple enough, let's get it done.\n\n\n", "response": "This is my answer: Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.", "wer": 0.0, "exact_match": true, "answer_correct": true}
