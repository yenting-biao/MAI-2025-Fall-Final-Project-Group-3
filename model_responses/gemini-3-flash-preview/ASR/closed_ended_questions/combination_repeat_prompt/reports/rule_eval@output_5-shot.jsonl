So, that means: \"suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape\".\n\nOkay, now let's double-check the audio, focusing on the phrasing and punctuation. I hear \"Suddenly he heard him at the very door, there was no possible escape.\" Aha! So the audio actually *does* have a comma. The examples haven't used any punctuation at all. Okay. Lowercase: \"suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape\".\n\nLet's do another quick check. The prompt said to convert to written text. Let's make sure I'm not missing anything.
