Done: \"Now what have you to say, Cynthia Sprague?\"\n\nThe instructions say to wrap the transcription in `<< >>`. Noted.\n\nNow, I have to match the formatting style of the examples.

So, the transcription, following these rules, is: `now what have you to say cynthia sprague`. The previous examples have an apostrophe in them, like \"it's\" so I am going to make sure to follow this as it is used in the audio.\n\nApplying the `<< >>` wrapping: `<<now what have you to say cynthia sprague>>`.\n\nHold on, let me double-check the name. It *sounds* like \"Cynthia Sprague,\" but it's important to be accurate. \"Sprague\" sounds familiar. Let's re-listen one last time to confirm. \"Now what have you to say, Cynthia Sprague?\" Yep, sounds right.\n\nAll checks are done! Formatting is consistent.

The task is to transcribe this audio, and I need to be absolutely certain of the words. First listen, it sounds like \"But in their selection of a constitution, the Brissotins have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties.\" I need to verify that \"Brissotins\". I'm pretty sure it's the right faction, but let's double-check. Yup, definitely \"Brissotins,\" referring to that specific group in the French Revolution. I should re-verify that the text says \"Brissotins\". \"But in their selection of a constitution, the Brissotins have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties.\"\n\nI need to confirm the spelling: \"Brissotins\" is correct. Now, \"selection of a constitution,\" that sounds right. \"Allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly,\" and finally, \"and hence has sprung their present difficulties.\" I briefly considered \"Brutus\" but that's incorrect. I can probably consider the historical context here, maybe a quote from John Adams or similar? Yes, \"Brissotins\" is a common term in that era. Now, let's re-listen to that first phrase, make sure I am on the correct track: \"But in their selection of a constitution, the Brissotins...\" Yes.\n\nThe full sentence is: \"But in their selection of a constitution, the Brissotins have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties.\" I need to re-listen for \"has\" or \"have\". Yes it sounds like \"has\". I need to confirm \"Brissotins\" again. Yes, it is that word.\n\nThe final text should be: \"but in their selection of a constitution the brissotins have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties.\" I need to make sure the audio did not say \"selection of their constitution.\" \"But in their selection of a constitution...\" Okay. I also need to be certain about the spelling of \"Brissotins\". \"Brissotins\" is the standard spelling for the followers of Brissot. Yes, the ending is definitely \"...and hence has sprung their present difficulties.\" Checking the audio again: \"But in their selection of a constitution, the Brissotins have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly, and hence has sprung their present difficulties.\" and making sure the word is \"deliberate.\" Ok, final transcription: \"but in their selection of a constitution the brissotins have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties.\"\n\n<<but in their selection of a constitution the brissotins have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties>>\n\n\n", "response": "[ANS] <<but in their selection of a constitution the brissotins have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprung their present difficulties>> ", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "", "wer": 1.0, "exact_match": false, "answer_correct": false}

Even though the audio is a question, the examples show no question marks.\n\nAlright, so the transcription should be: `<<since when has malady banished medicine>>`. I should give the audio another listen.
