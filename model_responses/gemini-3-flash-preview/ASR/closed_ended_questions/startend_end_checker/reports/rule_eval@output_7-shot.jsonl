Let me play it back. Hmmm, it's *possible* it's \"press-users\", a compound word, though it's not the most natural phrase. Wait a minute... that sounds more like \"precieuses.\" Ah, yes! \"Precieuses\" - French for \"precious\" or \"affected\". That makes a LOT more sense in the context of \"affected lady.\" It's a literary term, often used to describe women with overly refined speech and mannerisms. Moliere's \"Les Précieuses Ridicules\" jumps to mind.\n\nJust to be absolutely certain, let me listen one last time. Yup, definitely \"precieuses.\" Considering the previous responses I have seen, I need to provide a very literal response, so I will now construct the final response.\n\n[ANS] there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses\nThis marks the end of my answer.\n\n\n", "response": " [ANS] there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses\nThis marks the end of my answer.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses", "wer": 0.0, "exact_match": true, "answer_correct": true}
