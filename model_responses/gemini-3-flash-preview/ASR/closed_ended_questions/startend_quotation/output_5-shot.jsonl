Let's hear it... Right, \"What shall we do with the Mingos at the door? They count six, and the singer is as good as nothing.\" My initial thought is to make sure I'm hearing \"Mingos\" correctly. I have to make sure whether it is \"Mingos,\" \"mingoes,\" or something else entirely. After a few listens, it sounds like \"Mingos,\" though I should verify with context and common phrases if it is from a play or book. \"What shall we do with the Mingos at the door? They count six, and the singer is as good as nothing.\" Is that the phrase in full?\n\nI need to nail down each word. It could be \"minnows\" but that makes no sense. The audio is clear: \"Mingos,\" and \"the singer\". I should check for this specific text online in case it is from a book or play to make sure. Let's search... Ah, okay, it's starting to click. \"Mingoes\" refers to the Iroquois, often used in James Fenimore Cooper's work, like \"The Last of the Mohicans.\" That's a strong clue.\n\n\"What shall we do with the Mingoes at the door? They count six, and the singer is as good as nothing.\" The audio matches perfectly. \"the singer is as good as nothing\". Let's listen... Yes, \"the singer\". Double-checking that part is always wise.\n\nAlright, so the transcription is shaping up, but what's the style for the answer? I'm trying to follow the examples. From the examples I have: no capitalization, and no punctuation. So I need to produce my answer in lowercase, no final punctuation, but with apostrophes included (\"we'll\", \"doctor's\"). So my transcript would read something like: \"what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer is as good as nothing\".\n\nLet's re-verify the text one last time \"what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer is as good as nothing\" and listen to the audio one more time. Yep, the audio is correct.\n\nI am confident, the audio clearly says \"mingoes\". In Cooper's books, it's often spelled \"Mingoes\" but following the style guide, everything is lowercase.\n\nSo that gives me: \"what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer is as good as nothing\".\n\n\n", "response": " [ANS] \"what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer is as good as nothing\"  "}

I went on.\" Hmm, looks right, but I need to make sure about the formatting. I'll check previous examples: \"i would like a new alarm clock\", \"don't forget a jacket\", \"maybe tomorrow it will be cold\", \"the surface is slick\", \"i think i have a doctor's appointment\". Okay, the examples are all lowercase. So I need to make it lowercase.\n\nI need to transcribe this in lowercase. Okay, \"did you ever have such a lordly guest before? i went on.\"\n\nNow, what about punctuation? Let's check the examples again. No punctuation at the end of any of those sentences. But, \"don't forget\" and \"doctor's\" show that apostrophes are kept. So, internal punctuation stays, but maybe no ending punctuation.\n\nLooking at the audio again, \"Did you ever have such a lordly guest before?\" is a question, and \"I went on.\" is a statement, but should the output keep that question mark or should I remove it?\n\nGiven the examples, let's go with no end punctuation.\n\nSo the transcription becomes \"did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on\".\n\nLet's verify the words: \"did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on\".\n\nNow I need to make sure I heard the words correctly: \"lordly\" or \"lovely\"? Listening again... it's \"lordly\".\n\nI am going to transcribe: \"did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on\"\n\nLet's double-check the audio again. \"Did you ever have such a lordly guest before?\" [pause] \"I went on.\" Confirmed, it's \"lordly.\"\n\nSo, the current transcription is: \"did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on\".\n\nWait, but are those sentences or dialogue? Yes, the phrase \"I went on\" is a dialogue tag. And all examples so far are single sentences. So I need to consider punctuation. No ending punctuation as shown in the examples.\n\nRe-examining: \"Did you ever have such a lordly guest before?\" I went on.\n\nLowercased: \"did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on\"\n\nNo apostrophes were needed.\nTherefore, the output should be: \"did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on\"\n\n\n", "response": "[ANS] \"did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on\""}

Interesting! All lowercase, no punctuation except apostrophes.\n\nBased on the pattern, I'll transcribe in lowercase. Apostrophes seem to be retained, such as with \"it's\" and \"we'll\" in prior examples. No periods, no commas. I should pay close attention to the spoken words, so I'll listen again to ensure accuracy.

First, I need to get a clear listen, making sure I haven't misheard anything. \"You were quite right to say no, Ambrose began, never smoke with Jago. His cigars will poison you.\" Got it. I need to make sure I get the names right, especially Jago, as that could be a variant.\n\nNext, I need to look at the examples provided to understand the expected formatting. The examples all seem to be lowercase with no end punctuation, although apostrophes are used for contractions and possessives. Okay, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nI'll transcribe the audio as I hear it, sticking with the lowercase format and no end punctuation, initially, and then I'll make sure there are no variations on what was said.\n\n\"you were quite right to say no ambrose began never smoke with jago his cigars will poison you\"\n\nLet me double-check the name, just in case. Is it \"Jago\" or \"Iago\"? Given the context and the literature I'm familiar with, Jago sounds right. Let me re-listen and make sure I heard the \"J\" sound properly. \"Jago.\" Yes, definitely a \"J\" sound.\n\nNow, a quick verification. \"You were quite right to say no,\" Ambrose began, \"never smoke with Jago. His cigars will poison you.\" The audio is clear. I have the transcription now and can ensure the output reflects what I've heard and verified.\n\nBased on the prompt and the examples, it should be in lowercase and without any end punctuation except for apostrophes. And while \"Ambrose\" and \"Jago\" are proper nouns, the examples used all lowercase. So, I will not capitalize them.\n\nI have double-checked that Ambrose began is transcribed correctly, and that \"never smoke with Jago his cigars will poison you\" is accurate too.\n\nBased on my understanding of the requirements, and my careful listening, the final transcription is:\n\n\"you were quite right to say no ambrose began never smoke with jago his cigars will poison you\"\n\n\n", "response": " [ANS] \"you were quite right to say no ambrose began never smoke with jago his cigars will poison you\""}
