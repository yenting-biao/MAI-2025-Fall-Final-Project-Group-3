Let me just listen to the provided audio, because my trained ear is pretty good at picking up on subtle vocal cues, I'll be listening for pitch and vocal resonance, expecting something fairly definitive. I'm listening for cues, and now I'm hearing what sounds like a lower pitch and that characteristic masculine resonance.\n\nRight, I'm happy with the audio analysis, but I should probably just check the visual data as well, if it's there. Just for confirmation, I'll be quick and check the video to see if there's any visual confirmation. Bingo, okay, there's a man speaking on screen. So, the visuals are aligning with the auditory cues here.\n\nAlright, the conclusion is pretty definitive at this point. With the audio cues and the visual confirmation, there's really no ambiguity.
