That's a clear constraint.\n\nNow, I'll need to confirm the transcription, but first I should make sure I have the pattern down, because, let's face it, consistency is key, and it's always good to review the method. I'll quickly look at the examples provided to make sure I understand the output format and that it's just a direct uppercase transcription.\n\nExcellent, the examples are exactly as I'd expect; direct transcriptions, all uppercase. Back to my current audio: \"He passed through Henley, Saint Albans, and came so near to London as Harrow on the Hill.\" Right, the only potential issue I see immediately is \"St Albans.\" I need to check the audio carefully because it could be \"St. Albans\" or \"Saint Albans.\" I will listen again and I can confirm that the speaker says \"Saint Albans.\"\n\nAll of that is straightforward. The transcription will be: \"HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY, SAINT ALBANS, AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL.\"\n\nJust to be certain, I'll do a quick word check to make sure I did not mishear anything. \"He passed through Henley\" - check. \"Saint Albans\" - check. \"and came so near to London\" - check. \"as Harrow on the Hill\" - check.\n\nPerfect.

So, I need to analyze the audio - in this case, the speaker says \"There's a whale, a whale, cried the professor\".\n\nNext, I need to ensure I'm following the formatting instructions *precisely*. The prompt has two key rules: transcribe the statement, and use only uppercase letters.\n\nNow, I'll draft the response based on the audio and format instructions. Based on that, I believe the response should be \"THERE'S A WHALE, A WHALE, CRIED THE PROFESSOR\".\n\nLet's check my work, comparing to the previous example:\n*   Audio: \"There's a whale, a whale, cried the professor\"\n*   Transcribed: THERE'S A WHALE, A WHALE, CRIED THE PROFESSOR.\n\nAh, yes, they all appear very straightforward. No trick formatting, just consistent execution.\n\nFinally, I'll do a final check: \"THERE'S A WHALE, A WHALE, CRIED THE PROFESSOR\".

Based on the prompt instructions, I need to provide the answer as `[ANS] <TEXT>`.\n\nFirst, I listen to the audio. Got it. Now to transcribe, accurately. \"I suppose though it's too early for them. Then came the explosion.\" Right, pretty straightforward. I'll start by converting it to all uppercase: \"I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM. THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION.\"\n\nNow, let's make sure I'm following the format and style of the examples provided. Looking back, some use punctuation, some don't. Specifically, I see apostrophes and also missing final periods. I see instances of \"IT'S\".\n\nI think I'll omit the periods, but I'll keep the apostrophes, as some examples use apostrophes. Therefore, based on the pattern of the examples provided, I should format the text as: \"I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION\".\n\nLet me verify that transcription with the audio again. \"I suppose though it's too early for them. Then came the explosion.\" Okay, the phrase ends at \"explosion\", so I'm correct. Double checking for accuracy, I think I have it now:  \"I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION\".\n\nLet me confirm that with the prior examples, and confirm apostrophes and no end punctuation.

Got it. The audio contains the phrase: \"Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because I am a girl?\".\n\nFirst, I listen to the audio: \"Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because I am a girl?\"\n\nThen, the transcription: WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL\n\nNow, I format it: [ANS] WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL\n\nLet's double-check the instructions, ensuring *everything* is uppercase, and that my answer has this format. The examples are helpful: `[ANS] TEXT`.\n\nOkay, back to the audio phrase: \"Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because I am a girl?\" I need to verify. \"Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because I am a girl?\" Yup.\n\nThe capitalized version is: WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL? (I'll remember to retain the question mark if it is present; but the instructions include no periods).\n\nNow, a quick comparison to the examples. Many of the examples do *not* include terminal punctuation, so I should probably omit it. Also, the word in question is \"inaction.\" Let me double check that: \"in-action\" or \"inaction\"? It is \"inaction\" (the state of not acting).\n\nSo, the transcript is: WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL. Let me re-verify that the audio is the same. \"Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because I am a girl?\". YES.\n\nI'm ready with the final formatted string: [ANS] WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL\n\n\n", "response": " [ANS] WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL  "}
