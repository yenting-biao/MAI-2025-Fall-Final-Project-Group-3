The pitch, from my expert ear, is definitely on the lower end of the spectrum, which is a strong indicator of a male voice.\n\nBased on that initial assessment of the vocal characteristics \u2013 the low pitch and generally masculine qualities \u2013 my immediate classification would be \"male\". It's a pretty clear-cut case from what I can hear.\n\nNow, let me just double-check the potential response options. Ah, yes, it's a simple binary choice: \"Male\" or \"Female.\" That aligns perfectly with my initial analysis. And, of course, the user wants me to format the response a particular way.

I'll need to listen carefully. Once I've made my determination, I'll then format the response exactly as requested, beginning with \"The correct answer is:\" followed by the lowercase gender term.
