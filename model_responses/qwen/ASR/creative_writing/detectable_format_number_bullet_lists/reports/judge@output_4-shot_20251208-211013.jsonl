The instruction says to explain the delivery style in three bullet points, so maybe the model should have just the bullets. However, the model included a leading sentence before the bullets.

The user wants me to evaluate if the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to write an alternate ending using 3 bullet points. \n\nLooking at the model's response, the first part is a description of the audio, which isn't necessary. Then there are three bullet points. Wait, the first bullet point has two sub-bullets. So that's a problem. The instruction asked for 3 bullet points, but the model used a main bullet with two sub-bullets, making it more than three. Also, the first bullet starts with an asterisk, but the sub-bullets use two asterisks, which might not be correct. \n\nThe main issue is that the structure isn't three separate bullet points. Instead, the first one has two subpoints. So the format is incorrect. The model didn't follow the exact structure required. The user wanted three bullet points, but the response has four elements (the first bullet plus two subpoints). That's a major constraint violation. \n\nSo the if_score should be lower. Since the main constraint about the number of bullet points is violated, but the content is in bullet form, maybe 0.6? Wait, but the user specified exactly three bullet points. The model's answer has three bullet points, but the first one has two subpoints. Wait, let me check again. The model's response has:\n\n* The woman realizes... (1)\n  * She then... (2)\n  * She eventually... (3)\n\nSo that's three bullet points, but the first one has two sub-bullets. Wait, no. The first bullet is one point, then two subpoints. So in total, there are three points. But the structure is not correct. The instruction said to use three bullet points, but the model's answer has a main bullet with two subpoints. So the format is incorrect. \n\nThe explicit constraint is to use three bullet points. The model's answer has three bullet points, but the first one is a main point with two subpoints. So maybe the user intended three separate bullet points, but the model's structure is different. This is a formatting issue. The user might have expected three separate bullets, but the model's answer has a nested structure. \n\nSo the model didn't follow the exact format. Therefore, the if_score should be 0.6 because the main constraints are violated (format) but the content is in bullet form. Alternatively, if the user considered the three points as three bullets, even with subpoints, maybe it's 0.8.

But the user might have intended three separate points. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the model's answer has three bullet points, even though one is nested. So the explicit constraint of three bullet points is met. However, the style might not be correct. \n\nIn that case, the model did follow the number of bullet points, but the structure is nested.

Alternatively, if the user considers the three bullet points as correct, even with nesting, then it's 1.0. But since the user's instruction didn't mention nesting, the model's answer might not follow the style. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. But the main point is that the model used three bullet points. The instruction said \"using 3 bullet points.\" So the model met that. The issue is with the sub-bullets. But the instruction didn't specify that bullets should be at the same level. So maybe the model followed the explicit constraint. However, the user might have intended three separate bullet points. \n\nIn this case, the model's answer has three bullet points, but the first one has two subpoints.

Therefore, the if_score is 1.0. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the user might have intended three separate bullet points, and the model's answer has three, but one is a subpoint. So maybe the answer is 0.8. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But given that the model used three bullet points, even with nesting, the explicit constraint is met. Therefore, the if_score should be 1.0. However, the user might have considered the nested structure as not following the style. But since the instruction didn't specify, it's safer to assume that the model followed the explicit constraint. Therefore, the if_score is 1.0. \n\nWait, but the first bullet has two subpoints. So the total number of bullet points is three. The user might have intended three separate points, but the model's answer has one point with two subpoints. So the structure is not three separate bullets. Therefore, the model didn't follow the format. So the if_score should be 0.6. \n\nI think this is the correct approach. The model's answer has three bullet points, but the first one is a main point with two subpoints. So the structure is not three separate bullet points. Therefore, the format is incorrect.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction was to explain the speaker’s delivery style in 3 bullet points. \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The instruction specifies three bullet points. Let me look at the model's response. It starts with a sentence, then has three bullet points. Wait, the model used asterisks (*) for bullets, which is correct. The user didn't specify a particular format beyond bullet points, so that's fine.\n\nNow, the content. The user said to ignore factual correctness, so even if the tone descriptions are accurate or not, I don't care. The main thing is the format. The model provided exactly three bullet points, which matches the instruction. The initial sentence before the bullets might be an issue. The instruction didn't ask for an introductory sentence, just the bullet points. So that's an extra line. But the user's examples mention that explicit constraints include required number of items or bullet points. The model did provide three bullets, so that's correct. The initial sentence might be a minor issue, but since the main constraint was three bullets, and they met that, maybe it's a cosmetic issue. \n\nSo the score would be 1.0 if the bullets are correct. But the model added a sentence before the bullets. However, the instruction didn't mention any specific format beyond the bullet points. So the presence of that sentence might be a minor issue, but the main constraint of three bullets is met. Therefore, it's almost perfect, so 0.8? Or is the initial sentence a violation? Wait, the instruction says \"Explain the speaker’s delivery style in 3 bullet points.\" So the model's response starts with a sentence, then the bullets. The instruction didn't specify that the bullets should be the entire response. So the model included an introductory sentence, which wasn't required. That could be a minor issue. But the main constraint was three bullets, which were there. So maybe it's a 0.8 because of that extra sentence. Alternatively, if the model's answer is structured correctly with three bullets, even if there's an intro sentence, maybe it's still 1.0. Wait, the user's examples mention that explicit constraints include required number of items or bullet points. The model provided three bullets. The presence of the intro sentence isn't a constraint. So maybe the model followed the main constraint. Therefore, the score is 1.0. But wait, the user says to focus only on the format, style, and explicit constraints. The instruction didn't require the bullets to be the only content, but the model added an extra line. However, the explicit constraint was three bullet points, which were met. So the intro sentence might be a minor issue, but the main constraints are respected. Therefore, the score is 1.0. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. The instruction says \"Explain the speaker’s delivery style in 3 bullet points.\" The model's answer starts with a sentence and then has three bullets. The instruction didn't specify that the bullets should be the only content. So the model included an introductory sentence, which might not be required. However, the main constraint was three bullet points, which were met. So the intro sentence is a minor issue, but the main constraints are followed. Therefore, the score should be 1.0. But wait, the user's examples might have similar cases. For example, if the instruction says \"list three items\" and the response has a sentence followed by three items, that's a minor issue. So in this case, the model followed the explicit constraint of three bullet points, so the score is 1.0. But the user's rubric says 0.8 is almost perfect with tiny cosmetic issues. So if the intro sentence is a cosmetic issue, then the score is 0.8. But maybe the model's answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe the model's answer is correct because the bullets are there. The instruction didn't specify that the answer should be only the bullets. So the model's answer includes a sentence followed by bullets. But the instruction says \"explain... in 3 bullet points,\" which might imply that the bullets are the explanation. So the initial sentence might be unnecessary. However, the user's instruction doesn't say that the bullets should be the only content. So maybe it's acceptable. Therefore, the model followed the explicit constraint of three bullet points, so the score is 1.0. But maybe the presence of the intro sentence is a violation of the format. If the instruction requires the answer to be exactly three bullet points without any other text, then the model's answer would have an extra line. However, the instruction didn't specify that. Therefore, the model followed the main constraint. So the score is 1.0. But I'm not sure. Maybe the user considers the intro sentence as a violation. Let me think again. The instruction says \"Explain the speaker’s delivery style in 3 bullet points.\" The model's answer starts with a sentence, then three bullets. The user's instruction didn't specify that the answer should be only the bullets. So the model's answer is correct. Therefore, the score is 1.0. However, the user might have intended the answer to be only the bullets. But since the instruction didn't specify, it's allowed. Therefore, the answer is 1.0. But maybe the model's answer is not following the format. The instruction says \"explain... in 3 bullet points,\" which could mean that the entire answer is the three bullets. So the model's answer has an extra sentence, which is a violation. Therefore, the score is 0.8. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But according to the user's instructions, the focus is on explicit constraints. The main explicit constraint was three bullet points. The model provided three bullets. The presence of an introductory sentence might be a minor issue, but not a major one. Therefore, the score is 1.0. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the model's answer is structured with an intro sentence followed by bullets, then the format is not exactly as per the instruction. But since the instruction didn't specify that the answer should be only the bullets, it's acceptable. Therefore, the answer is 1.0. I think the correct score is 1.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 1.0, \"reason\": \"The response includes exactly three bullet points as required, adhering to the explicit constraint of formatting the explanation in bullet points.\"}", "if_score": 1.0, "if_reason": "The response includes exactly three bullet points as required, adhering to the explicit constraint of formatting the explanation in bullet points.", "if_level": "strict"}

The user wants me to evaluate how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to list 2 likely reasons why the audio was recorded, formatted as bullet points.\n\nFirst, I need to check the format. The model response uses bullet points with asterisks, which matches the requirement. But wait, the instruction specifies exactly two reasons. Let me count. The response has two bullet points, so that's good. \n\nNext, the style. The instruction doesn't mention any specific style beyond bullet points, so the model's use of bullet points is correct. However, the content is in English, which is fine. \n\nNow, explicit constraints. The main ones are the number of bullet points (exactly 2) and the format (bullet points). The model met both. But wait, the first bullet starts with \"The person is trying to convey...\" and the second with \"The person is experiencing...\". Are these two distinct reasons? The user might consider them as separate, but the instruction just asks for two reasons regardless of their content. \n\nAlso, the model uses \"可能\" which is Chinese, but the instruction didn't specify language. Wait, the original instruction is in English, so the model's response should be in English. Wait, looking back, the model response is in English. Wait, the user's instruction is in English, so the model's answer should be in English. But the response here is in English. Wait, the model's answer is in English. So that's okay. \n\nWait, the model's answer starts with \"Based on the voice...\" which is an introduction, but the instruction just says to list two reasons as bullet points. The model included an introductory sentence before the bullets. The instruction didn't mention any introduction, so that might be a problem. The user might have expected just the bullets without any extra text. \n\nSo the model included an introductory sentence, which wasn't part of the explicit constraints. The instruction was to list two reasons as bullet points, so the model's response has that, but with an extra paragraph. That might be a minor issue. \n\nSo the main constraints are met: two bullet points, correct format. The extra text is a cosmetic issue. So the score should be 1.0 if the extra text is allowed, but if the instruction strictly requires only the bullets, then it's a minor issue. But the instruction says \"list 2... formatted as bullet points.\" The model did that, even with the intro. But the intro isn't part of the explicit constraints. However, the user said to ignore content relevance and focus on format, style, and explicit constraints. The explicit constraints here are the number of bullets and the format. The intro isn't part of the constraints, so it's a minor issue. Therefore, the score would be 1.0 because the main constraints are met. Wait, but the model's response includes an intro, which might be considered a style issue. However, the instruction didn't specify that the response should be only the bullets. So maybe the intro is allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model should have just the bullets without any text. But the instruction didn't specify that. So the main constraints are met. Therefore, the if_score is 1.0. Wait, but the user's example in the instructions says that if there's an explicit constraint on the number of items, then that's important. The model met that. The intro is not an explicit constraint, so it's a style issue but not a constraint violation. So the score would be 1.0. \n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to focus on explicit constraints. The intro isn't an explicit constraint. So the model followed the explicit constraints. Therefore, the score is 1.0. However, the user might consider the intro as a problem. But according to the guidelines, we should ignore content relevance and focus on the explicit constraints. So the answer is 1.0. \n\nWait, but the model's response includes an introductory sentence before the bullet points. The instruction didn't ask for that. However, the instruction didn't say that the response should not have any introduction. So it's a style issue but not a constraint violation. Therefore, the model followed the explicit constraints (number of bullets and format), so the score is 1.0. \n\nWait, but the user's example says that if the model includes an extra text, like an introduction, that's a cosmetic issue. The rubric says 0.8 for almost perfect with tiny cosmetic issues. But in this case, the model did exactly what was asked (two bullets), so the intro is a minor issue. So the score would be 0.8? \n\nBut the instruction didn't mention anything about not having an intro. So the model followed the explicit constraints (two bullets, correct format), so it's 1.0. The intro is a style issue but not a constraint violation. Therefore, the score is 1.0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model's response has the bullets but the intro is not part of the required output. The instruction says \"list 2... formatted as bullet points.\" The model's response includes an intro and then the bullets. So the intro is extra. But the instruction didn't say to omit it.

The model response starts by stating the speaker's point of view, which is \"Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.\" Then they provide two bullet points. Wait, the first bullet is about optimism regarding weather improving, and the second is about desiring a temperature drop. But the original statement is about possibly cold weather, not necessarily improving. The model's first bullet seems contradictory. Also, the second bullet mentions a desire for temperature to drop, which might not align with the original statement. However, the main thing here is the format. The user asked for two bullet points, and the model provided two. The first bullet has a sub-bullet, making it three points.

Also, the content might not exactly match the speaker's POV, but according to the rules, I should ignore content correctness. The explicit constraints are the format: two bullet points. The model's response has two main bullets, but the first one has a sub-bullet. So that's three items. So the model violated the required number of bullet points. Therefore, the format is incorrect. So the if_score should be lower. Let me check again. The model's response has two bullet points, but the first one has a nested bullet. So the total is three points. So the model didn't follow the required two bullet points. That's a major constraint violation. So the score would be 0.3. But maybe the user meant two main points, and the sub-bullet is allowed. Wait, the instruction says \"2 bullet points\". So the model's response has two main bullets, but the first one has a sub-bullet. So that's three items. Therefore, the model didn't meet the explicit constraint of two bullet points. So the score is 0.3. The reason is that the response has more than two bullet points.

So even if the content is off-topic, if the format is wrong, it's a problem. \n\nSo the main issues are: not using bullet points, not providing four items. The answer is a single sentence. So the format is completely off. Therefore, the score should be low. According to the rubric, 0.0 is not following at all. But maybe there's some partial credit? The instruction says to look only at explicit constraints. The model didn't meet the required number of bullet points. So it's violating a major constraint. Hence, the score should be 0.0. \n\nBut wait, maybe the model tried to answer but didn't follow the format. The answer is a single sentence, so it's not in bullet points. So the answer doesn't meet the required format. So the if_score should be 0.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 0.0, \"reason\": \"The response does not use bullet points and only provides one sentence instead of four bullet points as required.\"}", "if_score": 0.0, "if_reason": "The response does not use bullet points and only provides one sentence instead of four bullet points as required.", "if_level": "not_follow"}

The model response starts with \"Based on the audio, 3 ways...\" which seems like an introduction. Then there are three numbered points, each starting with a bold number and a hyphen. Wait, the instruction says bullet points, but the model used numbers. But maybe that's acceptable as long as they're listed as points. However, the example in the instruction might have used bullets, but the model used numbers. Hmm, but the key is whether the format matches. The user said to focus on explicit constraints like required number of items. The instruction asks for 3 bullet points. The model provided three points, each as a numbered list. So maybe that's okay. But the user might consider bullet points as using dashes or asterisks. However, the model used numbers, which is a different format. But the instruction didn't specify the exact format, just \"bullet points.\" So maybe numbers are acceptable as a form of bullet points. \n\nNext, the model response includes explanations for each point. The instruction just says to describe how to enhance the message, so providing explanations is fine. The user said to ignore content correctness, so even if the advice is good or bad, it's not a problem. \n\nThe model response has exactly three points, which matches the instruction's requirement. The language is in English, which is correct. The structure is clear. The only possible issue is the use of numbers instead of bullet points. But maybe the user considers numbered lists as acceptable. Alternatively, the model might have used a different format. However, the instruction didn't specify the exact formatting, just \"bullet points,\" which could be interpreted as any list format. \n\nSo, the model followed the explicit constraints: three points, correct language, and structure. The only possible minor issue is the use of numbers instead of bullets, but that's a cosmetic difference. Therefore, the score should be 1.0. But wait, the example in the instruction might have used bullets, but the model used numbers. However, the user's instruction says \"bullet points\" but the model used numbered points. But in some contexts, numbered lists are considered bullet points. Alternatively, maybe the user expects dashes or asterisks. If the model used numbers, that's a format deviation. However, the instruction didn't specify the exact style, just the number of items. So maybe the main constraint is met. Therefore, the score is 1.0. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"3 bullet points.\" The model response uses numbered points. So the format is different. But the instruction might consider any list format as acceptable. However, if the user strictly requires bullet points (like using dashes or asterisks), then the model's use of numbers would be a violation. But the user's instruction doesn't specify the exact format, just the number of items. So the main constraint is met. Therefore, the model followed the explicit constraints. So the score is 1.0. \n\nBut maybe the user considers bullet points as using dashes or asterisks. If the model used numbers, that's a different format.
