The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction was to explain the speaker’s delivery style in 3 bullet points. \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The instruction specifies three bullet points. The model response has three bullet points, so that's good. Each bullet point is a separate item, so the number is correct.\n\nNext, the format. The instruction says to use bullet points, and the model used asterisks (*), which is a common way to denote bullets. The response starts with \"The speaker's delivery style can be described as follows:\" followed by the bullets. But the instruction didn't mention any specific formatting beyond bullet points. However, the example given in the problem statement might have shown that the model should just list the bullets without the introductory sentence. Wait, the original instruction says \"Explain the speaker’s delivery style in 3 bullet points.\" So maybe the model should have just the three bullets without the introductory text. But the model included that line. Hmm, does that matter?\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to focus on the format, style, and explicit constraints. The explicit constraints here are the number of bullet points (3) and the format (bullet points). The model provided exactly three bullet points, each starting with an asterisk. The introductory sentence before the bullets might not be required. However, the instruction didn't specify that the response should not have any text before the bullets. So maybe that's a style issue but not an explicit constraint. The main thing is that the three bullet points are there. \n\nAnother thing to check: the language. The instruction didn't specify a language, but the model used English, which is fine. \n\nSo the model followed the explicit constraints: three bullet points, each as a separate item. The introductory sentence might be a minor issue, but since the instruction didn't mention it, it's not a constraint violation. Therefore, the model perfectly follows the constraints. So the if_score should be 1.0. \n\nWait, but the user's example in the problem statement shows that the model's response includes the introductory text. However, the instruction didn't require that. So maybe the model added extra text, which isn't part of the constraints. But the main thing is that the three bullet points are there. So even if there's an introductory sentence, the main constraint of three bullet points is met. Therefore, the score is 1.0. \n\nBut wait, maybe the instruction expects only the bullet points, not any additional text. If the model included the introductory line, that might be a problem. However, the instruction didn't specify that the response should be only the bullet points. The user's instruction says \"explain in 3 bullet points,\" which could be interpreted as the entire response being three bullet points. So the model's response starts with a sentence and then has three bullets. That might be a violation of the format. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to \"Explain the speaker’s delivery style in 3 bullet points.\" So the expected format is three bullet points, each explaining a part of the delivery style. The model's response starts with a sentence, then has three bullets. So the initial sentence is not part of the bullet points. But the instruction didn't say to omit that. However, the model's response might have included extra text that's not required. But the main constraint is the three bullets. So the model did meet the explicit constraints. Therefore, the if_score is 1.0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model's response should have only the three bullets, without the introductory sentence. But the instruction didn't specify that. So the presence of the introductory sentence isn't an explicit constraint violation.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to write an alternate ending using 3 bullet points. \n\nFirst, I need to check the format. The model response starts with a description of the audio, which isn't part of the required format. The user didn't ask for that, so that's a problem. Then, the response does have three bullet points, which matches the required number. Each bullet is a separate point, so that's good.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to use 3 bullet points. The model provided exactly three, so that's correct. However, the initial part about the audio description isn't needed. The user might have wanted just the bullet points. So the format isn't fully followed because of that extra text. \n\nThe style is also a bit off. The instruction didn't mention anything about describing the audio, so that's an unnecessary addition. But the main constraint was the three bullet points. The model did follow that. \n\nSo, the explicit constraints were: 3 bullet points. The model met that. But they added extra text, which might be a minor issue. Since the main constraint was met, maybe the score is 1.0? Wait, but the initial description isn't part of the required format. The user didn't ask for that. So the response includes extra information that wasn't required. That's a problem. \n\nBut the instruction didn't specify that the response should only have the bullet points. However, the user might have expected the answer to be only the bullet points. So the model included extra text, which violates the format. Therefore, the score should be lower. \n\nBut the main constraint was three bullet points. The model did that. The extra text is a cosmetic issue. So maybe it's 0.8? But the user said to focus on explicit constraints. The instruction didn't mention not including extra text, but the required format was three bullet points. So the main constraint was met. The extra text is a minor issue. So the score would be 1.0? Wait, but the user's instruction was to \"write an alternate ending using 3 bullet points.\" The model provided the bullet points, but also added a description. So the format isn't strictly followed. The user might have wanted only the bullet points. Therefore, the model didn't follow the format. So the score would be 0.6? \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The main explicit constraint was three bullet points. The model did that. The extra text is not part of the required format. But the instruction didn't say to exclude that. However, the user's instruction is to write the alternate ending using bullet points. The model's answer includes the bullet points but also a description. So the format isn't strictly followed. Therefore, the score should be 0.8 because the main constraint was met, but there's extra text. Alternatively, maybe the extra text is considered a violation of the format. \n\nWait, the instruction says to \"write an alternate ending for the content in the audio using 3 bullet points.\" The model's response includes a description of the audio, which isn't part of the required format. So that's an issue. The required format is three bullet points. The model provided three bullet points, but added other text. So the format isn't followed. Therefore, the score is 0.6 because the main constraint (three bullet points) is met, but the extra text is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the answer to be only the bullet points. So the model's answer includes extra text, which is a violation. Therefore, the score is 0.6. But the user might not have specified that. So, the main constraint was met. So the score is 1.0? But the user said to focus on the explicit constraints. The explicit constraint was three bullet points. The model did that. The extra text is not an explicit constraint. So the score is 1.0. But the model's answer starts with a description, which isn't part of the required format. \n\nWait, the instruction says to \"write an alternate ending for the content in the audio using 3 bullet points.\" The model's response includes a description of the audio, then the three bullet points. The required format is three bullet points. So the model's answer includes the bullet points, but also extra text. So the format isn't strictly followed. Therefore, the score is 0.8 because the main constraint is met, but there's extra text. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model's answer is acceptable because the three bullet points are there, even if there's extra text. But the instruction didn't specify that the answer should only have the bullet points. So the model followed the explicit constraint of three bullet points. Therefore, the score is 1.0. \n\nBut the user's instruction says \"using 3 bullet points,\" so the answer should be in the format of three bullet points. The model's answer includes that, but also adds a description. So the format is not strictly followed. Therefore, the score is 0.8. \n\nHmm. I think the correct score is 1.0 because the main explicit constraint (three bullet points) is met. The extra text is not part of the explicit constraints. So the model followed the main requirement. Therefore, the score is 1.0. But I'm not sure. Maybe the extra text is considered a violation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the answer to be only the bullet points. In that case, the model's answer includes extra text, so the format is violated. Therefore, the score is 0.6. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But according to the user's instruction, the main constraint was three bullet points. The model met that. The extra text is not an explicit constraint. So the score should be 1.0. \n\nBut the user might have considered the extra text as a violation of the format. For example, if the instruction said \"only bullet points,\" then the extra text would be a problem. But the instruction didn't specify that. Therefore, the model followed the explicit constraints. So the score is 1.0. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"write an alternate ending for the content in the audio using 3 bullet points.\" The model's answer includes the three bullet points, but also a description. So the answer is not just the bullet points. Therefore, the format isn't followed. The model's answer is not in the required format. Therefore, the score is 0.6. \n\nBut the user didn't specify that the answer should only have the bullet points. So the model's answer includes the bullet points, which is the main constraint. The extra text is not part of the required format. Therefore, the score is 0.8. \n\nI think the correct answer is 0.8 because the main constraint is met, but the extra text is a cosmetic issue. So the score is 0.8. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the user expects the answer to be only the bullet points. Therefore, the model's answer includes extra text, which is a violation. So the score is 0.6. \n\nI think the answer is 0.8 because the main constraint is met, and the extra text is a minor issue.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction was to imagine the audio as a movie scene and describe it in 5 bullet points. \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The main ones here are the format and the number of bullet points. The instruction says \"5 bullet points,\" so the response should have exactly five.\n\nLooking at the model's response: the first part is a description of the audio, which is a woman speaking in English. Then there's a list that starts with \"The scene takes place...\" and continues with several points. Let me count the bullet points. \n\nThe first bullet is about the scene place and the woman sitting. Then the second is about her speaking to someone off-screen. Third is the room's lighting. Fourth is her clothing and appearance. Fifth is the camera zooming in. That's five bullet points. So the count is correct.\n\nBut wait, the initial part before the bullets is a paragraph describing the audio. The instruction didn't mention that, so maybe that's an issue. The user asked to describe the audio as a movie scene in bullet points. The model included a paragraph before the bullets, which might be a problem. The explicit constraint is to use bullet points, so the initial paragraph isn't part of the required format. \n\nHowever, the instruction says \"describe it in 5 bullet points,\" so the model's answer includes the bullets. The initial paragraph might be an extra, but the main requirement is met. The user didn't specify that the answer should only be the bullets, but the instruction might have implied that. \n\nAlso, the model's answer has exactly five bullet points. The format is correct. The style is a list, which matches the instruction. The explicit constraints are the number of bullets and the format. The model followed those. \n\nSo the if_score should be 1.0 because it meets the required number of bullet points and uses the correct format. The initial paragraph might be a minor issue, but the instruction didn't mention excluding that, so maybe it's allowed. Alternatively, maybe the user expected only the bullet points. But since the instruction says \"describe it in 5 bullet points,\" the model's answer includes that. The initial paragraph could be considered as part of the description, but the main constraint is the bullet points. \n\nTherefore, the model followed the explicit constraints, so the score is 1.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 1.0, \"reason\": \"The response includes exactly 5 bullet points as requested, adhering to the format and explicit constraint.\"}", "if_score": 1.0, "if_reason": "The response includes exactly 5 bullet points as requested, adhering to the format and explicit constraint.", "if_level": "strict"}

The instruction says to list 2 likely reasons why the audio was recorded, formatted as bullet points. \n\nFirst, check the format. The model response starts with some analysis, then lists two bullet points. Wait, the instruction says to format as bullet points, but the model used numbers (1. and 2.). Are numbers considered bullet points? Maybe not exactly. The user might expect dashes or asterisks. But maybe in some contexts, numbers are acceptable. However, the main thing is that they have two points. \n\nNext, the explicit constraints: the user asked for exactly two reasons. The model provided two. The format is bullet points, but they used numbers. So maybe that's a minor issue. The instruction didn't specify the exact formatting symbols, just bullet points.

The response should just list the two reasons without any introductory text. \n\nSo the model didn't follow the format exactly because of the numbering and the extra text. But the main constraint of having two bullet points was met. However, the style might be off. So maybe the score is 0.6 because it's mostly following but has some issues with the format.

However, the explicit constraint is to list two reasons as bullet points. The model's response has two points, but the format is not exactly bullet points. \n\nSo the model partially followed the instruction. Therefore, the score might be 0.6.

The instruction says to create a response from the speaker's point of view in 2 bullet points. \n\nFirst, check the format. The model used bullet points, which is correct. But wait, the example given in the model response has two bullet points. The first bullet is a statement about the speaker's emotion, and the second is an example response. However, the instruction asks for a response to the speaker's POV, not an analysis of the speaker's emotion. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create a response that reflects the speaker's point of view. So the model's first bullet is about the speaker's emotion, which might not be the response itself. The second bullet gives an example of a response. But the instruction says \"create a response,\" so maybe the model should have provided two bullet points that are the actual response, not an analysis. \n\nBut the model's response has two bullet points. The first is an analysis, and the second is an example. However, the instruction might be ambiguous. If the instruction is to create a response (like a reply) in two bullet points, then the model's approach might not fit. However, the model did use two bullet points as required. \n\nWait, the instruction says \"create a response to the speaker’s point of view in 2 bullet points.\" So the response should be two bullet points that are the actual response, not an analysis. The model's first bullet is about the speaker's emotion, which is not the response. The second bullet is an example of a response. So maybe the model misunderstood the instruction. \n\nBut the model did follow the format of two bullet points. However, the content might not be correct. But according to the rules, we should ignore factual correctness and focus on format and explicit constraints. The explicit constraint is two bullet points. The model provided two bullet points, so that's met. \n\nBut wait, the instruction says \"create a response to the speaker’s point of view,\" which might mean that the response should be from the speaker's perspective. The model's first bullet is about the speaker's emotion, and the second is an example of a response. So maybe the model's structure is incorrect. However, the user's instruction might have been ambiguous. \n\nSince the model followed the format of two bullet points, and the instruction's main explicit constraint is the number of bullet points, then the model meets that. However, the content might not be correct, but we are to ignore that. Therefore, the model's response follows the format and explicit constraints. So the if_score should be 1.0. \n\nWait, but the model's first bullet is not a response. It's an analysis. So maybe the model didn't follow the instruction correctly.

So the answer should be 1.0. \n\nBut maybe the instruction requires the response to be in two bullet points, which the model did. So the answer is 1.0.

The user wants me to evaluate how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction was to \"Describe the likely audience for this audio in 4 bullet points.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The main ones here are: the response must have exactly four bullet points, and the format should be bullet points. The model response starts with a paragraph, then lists four bullet points. Wait, the user's instruction didn't specify any particular language, so the language is fine (English). \n\nBut the model response starts with a sentence that's not a bullet point. The instruction says to describe the audience in four bullet points. The model provided four bullet points, but the initial paragraph might be a problem. However, the instruction didn't mention that the response should start with a title or anything else. The main thing is the four bullet points. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to \"Describe the likely audience... in 4 bullet points.\" The model response includes four bullet points. But the initial sentence before the bullets might be a problem. However, the instruction didn't specify that the response should not have any text before the bullets. So maybe that's a minor issue. \n\nBut the key is the format. The model used bullet points, which is correct. The instruction required four bullet points, and the model provided exactly four. The initial paragraph might be a cosmetic issue, but since the main constraint is met (four bullet points), the score should be high. \n\nHowever, the model's first sentence says \"Based on the voice, it sounds like this audio is suitable for a general audience...\" which is not part of the bullet points. The instruction didn't say to include an introductory sentence. So maybe that's an extra part. But the user's instruction only required four bullet points. The model included them, but added an introductory paragraph. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to describe the audience in four bullet points. The model response does that. The initial paragraph might be an issue, but the main constraint is met. So the score would be 1.0? Or is the initial paragraph a violation? \n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"Describe the likely audience for this audio in 4 bullet points.\" So the entire response should be the four bullet points. The model included an introductory sentence before the bullets, which might be a problem. But the instruction didn't specify that the response should be only the bullet points. So maybe the model added an extra sentence, which is not part of the required format. \n\nBut the user's instruction didn't mention that the response should not have any text before the bullets. So perhaps the model is following the instruction by providing four bullet points, even if there's an introductory sentence. However, the instruction could be interpreted as requiring only the bullet points. \n\nIn that case, the model's response includes an extra sentence, which might be a minor issue. But the main requirement is met. So the score would be 0.8 because there's a minor issue with the extra text. Alternatively, if the instruction is to have four bullet points, and the model did that, then the score is 1.0. \n\nBut the user's instruction says \"Describe the likely audience... in 4 bullet points.\" The model response includes four bullet points. The initial sentence is not part of the bullet points. So perhaps the model is following the instruction correctly. The initial sentence is part of the response, but the instruction didn't specify that the response should not have any other text. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to \"Describe the likely audience for this audio in 4 bullet points.\" So the entire response should be the four bullet points. The model's response includes a paragraph before the bullets, which might be a problem. But the instruction didn't specify that the response should be only the bullet points. So maybe the model is allowed to have an introductory sentence. \n\nBut the user's instruction is a bit ambiguous. However, in the example given in the problem statement, the user said to ignore whether the content is correct, so we focus on the format. The model response has four bullet points, which is exactly what the instruction asked for. The initial paragraph is not part of the bullet points, but the instruction didn't say to exclude it. \n\nBut the user's instruction is to \"Describe the likely audience... in 4 bullet points.\" So the answer should be the four bullet points. The model's response includes an introductory sentence before the bullets. That might be a violation of the format, as the answer should be the four bullet points without any other text. \n\nIn that case, the model's response has four bullet points, which is correct, but there's an extra sentence before them. So the format is not perfectly followed. Therefore, the score would be 0.8 because there's a minor issue with the extra text. But if the instruction allows for an introductory sentence, then it's 1.0. \n\nBut the instruction didn't mention anything about the format beyond the bullet points. So the model's response is mostly correct, but the initial sentence is an extra. However, the user's instruction might be interpreted as requiring only the bullet points. Therefore, the model's response includes an extra sentence, which is a minor issue. \n\nSo the if_score would be 0.8 because there's a minor issue with the initial paragraph. Alternatively, if the instruction allows for the initial sentence, then it's 1.0. \n\nBut given that the instruction says \"Describe the likely audience... in 4 bullet points,\" the model's response should be the four bullet points. The initial sentence is not part of the required format. Therefore, the model response has an extra sentence, which is a minor issue. So the score is 0.8. \n\nBut wait, the model's response does include the four bullet points. The initial sentence is not part of the required format. So the main constraint is met (four bullet points), but there's an extra sentence. Therefore, the score is 1.0 because the main requirement is met, and the extra text is a cosmetic issue. \n\nHmm, the user's instruction says to \"describe the likely audience... in 4 bullet points.\" The model's response includes four bullet points. The initial sentence is not part of the bullet points. So the model is following the instruction correctly. The initial sentence is just an introduction, but the instruction didn't specify that it's not allowed. \n\nTherefore, the model's response meets the explicit constraints (four bullet points), so the if_score is 1.0. But maybe the initial sentence is not part of the required format. However, the user's instruction didn't mention that the response should be only the bullet points. Therefore, the model's response is acceptable. \n\nIn that case, the if_score is 1.0. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. \n\nThe instruction says to \"Describe the likely audience for this audio in 4 bullet points.\" The model response starts with a sentence, then lists four bullet points. The instruction didn't specify that the response should be only the bullet points. Therefore, the model's response includes the required four bullet points, and the initial sentence is an additional part. However, since the instruction didn't prohibit that, the model is following the constraints. \n\nThus, the if_score is 1.0. But wait, the user's instruction might have implied that the entire response should be the bullet points. However, without explicit constraints against additional text, the model's response is acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1.0. However, the initial sentence is not part of the bullet points. The instruction requires four bullet points. The model provides four bullet points, which is correct. The initial sentence is an extra, but not a violation. Therefore, the if_score is 1.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 1.0, \"reason\": \"The response includes exactly four bullet points as required by the instruction, adhering to the format and explicit constraints.\"}", "if_score": 1.0, "if_reason": "The response includes exactly four bullet points as required by the instruction, adhering to the format and explicit constraints.", "if_level": "strict"}

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction was to imagine the audio as a movie scene and describe it in 5 bullet points. \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The main ones here are: the output should be 5 bullet points, and the format should be bullet points. The model's response starts with a paragraph describing the audio, then provides a movie scene description. But wait, the user asked for bullet points, not a paragraph. The model's answer has a paragraph followed by a list, but the list isn't in bullet points. Instead, it's using line breaks and numbers. Also, the initial part about the audio isn't part of the bullet points. \n\nSo the model didn't follow the format requirement of 5 bullet points. They provided a paragraph and then a numbered list. The instruction was to describe the audio as a movie scene in 5 bullet points. The model's answer doesn't meet that. The answer has more than 5 points, but they're not in bullet form. Also, the initial part about the audio isn't part of the bullet points. \n\nLooking at the explicit constraints again: the required output format is bullet points. The model didn't use bullets, used numbers instead. Also, the number of points isn't exactly 5. The answer has 6 points in the list. So that's a problem. \n\nBut maybe the user considered the numbered list as bullet points? But the instruction says bullet points, which are usually dashes or asterisks. The model used numbers. That's a style issue. Also, the initial paragraph might be a problem because the instruction didn't ask for an introduction. \n\nSo the model didn't follow the format and style. The main constraints are the format (bullet points) and the number (5). The response didn't meet these. So the if_score would be low. \n\nLooking at the rubric: 0.3 is for partial following with major constraints violated. The model didn't use bullet points, used numbers instead, and the number of points is off. So maybe 0.3. But maybe there's some partial credit? The answer does describe the scene, but the format is wrong. So the main constraints are violated. Hence, 0.3. \n\nBut wait, the answer has 6 points. The instruction said 5. So that's another issue. So the model didn't meet the number of items. So the score is 0.3. The reason is that the response didn't use bullet points and had more than 5 points.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 0.3, \"reason\": \"The response did not use bullet points as required and included more than 5 points in a numbered list instead.\"}", "if_score": 0.3, "if_reason": "The response did not use bullet points as required and included more than 5 points in a numbered list instead.", "if_level": "not_follow"}

Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nList 4 details that reveal the speaker’s personality in bullet points. [ANS] Based on the audio, here are four details that reveal the speaker’s personality:\\n\\n*   **Pensive:** The speaker's slow, deliberate pacing suggests they are thoughtful and considering a possibility rather than making a definite statement.\\n*   **Subdued:** Their quiet volume and monotone delivery indicate a reserved or low-energy disposition.\\n*   **Non-committal:** Using the word \\\"maybe\\\" shows they are uncertain or hesitant to commit to a specific prediction.\\n*   **Calm:** The lack of emotional inflection in their voice suggests a placid and even-keeled temperament.

[ANS] Based on the audio clip, here are three observations about the speaker's attitude:\\n\\n*   **Alarmed and Urgent:** The speaker's loud, high-pitched tone conveys a sense of panic or urgency. They are not simply stating the time; they are exclaiming it as if it's a critical and problematic fact.\\n*   **Exasperated:** There is an undercurrent of frustration, suggesting that the time \\\"11 o'clock\\\" signifies that something is very late or a deadline has been missed, possibly despite a previous warning.\\n*   **Dramatic and Emphatic:** The speaker is intentionally emphasizing the time to maximize its impact on the listener. The delivery is theatrical and meant to convey a strong sense of crisis.

The user wants me to evaluate if the model response follows the instruction correctly. The instruction says, \"Describe how the speaker could enhance their message in 3 bullet points.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The instruction asks for exactly three bullet points. The model response starts with \"Based on the audio, 3 suggestions...\" and then lists three points. Each point is a bullet, so that's three items. The format here is a numbered list, but the instruction says \"bullet points.\" Wait, does that matter? The user might consider numbered lists as bullet points, but sometimes bullet points are dashes. However, the instruction didn't specify the exact formatting, just \"bullet points.\" The model used numbers, which is a bit different, but maybe that's acceptable. The key is the number of items, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the response is in English, which matches the requested language. The model didn't use any markdown, so the format is plain text. The instruction didn't specify any other constraints, like answer options or specific content. The main thing is the three bullet points. The response has three points, so that's good. \n\nBut wait, the instruction says \"bullet points,\" and the model used numbers. Is that a problem? If the user strictly requires bullets (like dashes or asterisks), then numbers might be a minor issue. However, sometimes people use numbers as bullet points. Since the instruction didn't specify the exact symbol, maybe it's acceptable. So the main constraint is met: three items. \n\nAlso, the response doesn't have any other issues. It's concise and follows the structure. So the if_score should be 1.0 because all explicit constraints are met. The only possible issue is the use of numbers instead of bullets, but that's a minor cosmetic difference. The user said to ignore whether the content is correct, just the format and constraints. Since the number of items is correct and the structure is a list, it's acceptable. Therefore, the score is 1.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 1.0, \"reason\": \"The response provides exactly 3 bullet points as requested, using numbered list format which is acceptable for bullet points, and follows all explicit constraints.\"}", "if_score": 1.0, "if_reason": "The response provides exactly 3 bullet points as requested, using numbered list format which is acceptable for bullet points, and follows all explicit constraints.", "if_level": "strict"}
