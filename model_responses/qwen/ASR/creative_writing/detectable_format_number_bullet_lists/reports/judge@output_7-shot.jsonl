The user wants me to evaluate how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction was to imagine the audio as a movie scene and describe it in 5 bullet points. \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The main ones here are: the output should be 5 bullet points, and the format should be bullet points. The model response starts with a paragraph describing the audio, then provides a scene description. Wait, the user asked for bullet points, but the model used a paragraph. Also, the model's response has four bullet points, not five. \n\nWait, looking again. The model's response has four bullet points. The instruction asked for five. So that's a problem. Also, the initial part of the response is a paragraph, which might not be in the required format. The user wanted bullet points, so the model didn't follow the format correctly. \n\nAdditionally, the model included a paragraph before the bullet points, which might be an extra part not required. The instruction didn't mention any introductory text, so that's a cosmetic issue. But the main issue is the number of bullet points. The user asked for five, but the response has four. \n\nSo, the model didn't meet the required number of bullet points. That's a significant constraint violation. But maybe the user's instruction was to describe the audio as a movie scene in 5 bullet points. The model provided four, which is one short. Also, the initial paragraph might be a mistake. \n\nSo, the main issues are: not enough bullet points (only four instead of five), and possibly not following the format strictly. Since the user asked for bullet points, the model's answer uses bullet points but with a wrong count. \n\nSo, the if_score would be 0.6 because the main constraints (format and number) are violated, but the style is somewhat followed. Wait, the model did use bullet points, but the count is wrong. The instruction said 5 bullet points. So the model provided four. That's a major issue. So maybe the score is lower. \n\nAlternatively, if the model's answer has four bullet points, that's a violation of the required number. So the score would be 0.3 because the main constraints (number of bullets) are violated. But the user might have considered that the model tried to follow but missed one. \n\nHmm. The instruction is explicit: 5 bullet points. The model response has four. So that's a major issue. So the score would be 0.3. But maybe the model's answer is in bullet points, so that's a partial follow. But the count is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model's answer is in bullet points, but the count is wrong. So the main constraint is the number. So the score would be 0.3. \n\nBut the model's answer has four bullet points. The user asked for five. So that's a clear violation. So the if_score is 0.3. \n\nBut wait, the model's answer starts with a paragraph, then bullet points. So the format is not exactly as required. The instruction says \"describe it in 5 bullet points.\" So the model's answer is not in bullet points. Wait, the model's answer has bullet points, but the initial part is a paragraph. So the format is not strictly followed. \n\nSo the model didn't follow the format exactly. So the if_score would be 0.3. \n\nBut maybe the user considered that the bullet points are there, but the count is wrong. So the score is 0.6. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But according to the rubric, if the main constraints are violated, like the required number of items, then it's a major issue. So the model response has four bullet points instead of five. That's a major constraint violation. So the score would be 0.3. \n\nBut the model's answer does use bullet points, so that's a partial follow. So the score might be 0.6. \n\nHmm. The instruction says \"describe it in 5 bullet points.\" The model's answer has four bullet points. So that's a violation. Therefore, the score is 0.3. \n\nBut maybe the user considers that the model's answer is mostly in bullet points, so the score is 0.6. \n\nI think the correct approach is to check the explicit constraints. The required number of bullet points is 5. The model provided 4. So that's a major issue. Therefore, the if_score is 0.3. \n\nBut the model's answer also has a paragraph before the bullet points. So that's an extra part. So that's another issue. \n\nSo, the model didn't follow the format (bullet points) and the number of items. So the score is 0.3. \n\nTherefore, the final answer would be 0.3.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 0.3, \"reason\": \"The response includes only 4 bullet points instead of the required 5, and includes an introductory paragraph which violates the format constraint.\"}", "if_score": 0.3, "if_reason": "The response includes only 4 bullet points instead of the required 5, and includes an introductory paragraph which violates the format constraint.", "if_level": "not_follow"}

That's a problem because the instruction specifically asked for two bullet points. So the format is wrong here.\n\nNext, the style. The original instruction says \"concise overview,\" but the response is a long sentence describing the audio content. It doesn't break it into two concise points. Also, the response includes a quote from the audio, which might not be necessary. \n\nExplicit constraints: the user required exactly two bullet points. The model didn't follow that. The response is a single paragraph, so that's a major issue. \n\nOther things: the content's factual accuracy isn't important here. The user just wants to check if the response adheres to the format and constraints. \n\nSo, the main issue is the format. The model didn't use bullet points. The instruction was clear about that. Even though the content might be correct, the structure is wrong. Therefore, the score should be low. \n\nLooking at the rubric: 0.0 is for not following at all. 0.3 is partial. Since the model didn't use bullet points and didn't meet the required format, maybe 0.3. But wait, the user said to ignore content correctness. So the main constraint is the two bullet points. The response has none. So it's a major violation. So maybe 0.0? Wait, but maybe the model tried to answer but didn't follow the format. The instruction says \"concise overview in 2 bullet points.\" The response is a paragraph, not bullets. So the format is completely wrong. So the score should be 0.0. But wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check again. The model's response is a single paragraph, not two bullets. So the format is not followed. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But the user's example says that 0.3 is for partial. However, the main constraint is the format. If the model didn't follow the required format (two bullets), then it's a major issue. So 0.0 is correct. Wait, but maybe the model's answer is in the right language (English) and the content is about the audio. But the format is wrong. So the answer doesn't follow the explicit constraints. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But maybe the user expects that the answer is not in bullet points but the instruction required it. So the answer is not following the format. So the if_score is 0.0. But the user's example for 0.3 is \"only partially follows; major constraints are violated.\" So maybe the model didn't meet the main constraint (two bullets), so it's a major violation. Therefore, the score is 0.0. Wait, but the user's instruction says to output 0.0 if it doesn't follow at all. So the model didn't use bullet points, so it's 0.0. But maybe the answer is a single paragraph, which is not the required format. So the answer doesn't follow the explicit constraints. Therefore, the if_score is 0.0. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check the rubric again. The instruction requires two bullet points. The model's response is a paragraph. So the format is wrong. So the answer doesn't follow the explicit constraints. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But maybe the user considers that the answer is in English, which is correct, but the format is wrong. So the answer doesn't meet the required format.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to describe the emotions in the audio with 3 bullet points, focusing on how they're expressed. \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The required format is three bullet points. Let me look at the model's response. The response starts with a paragraph, then lists two bullet points. Wait, the user asked for three, but the model only provided two. That's a problem. \n\nAlso, the instruction says to focus on how the emotions are expressed. The model's bullets mention \"voice's tone\" which is about expression, so that part is okay. But the count is off. They missed one bullet point. \n\nSo, the main issue is not meeting the required number of bullet points. The rest of the content seems to follow the style and focus. But since the count is wrong, that's a major constraint violation. The score should be 0.6 because the main constraints (number of points) are violated, but the style and focus are okay. Wait, but the user said to ignore content correctness. So even if the emotions are not correct, the structure is what matters. \n\nSo the model didn't follow the required three bullet points. They only have two. That's a significant issue. So the score would be 0.6 because it's mostly following but missing one bullet. Alternatively, maybe 0.3 if the number is a major constraint. Wait, the instruction says \"3 bullet points\", so that's an explicit constraint. Missing one would be a major issue. But the answer is only two, so that's a problem. \n\nHmm, the rubric says 0.3 is only partially follows, major constraints violated. Since the number of bullet points is a major constraint, missing one would be a major violation. But the user's example of explicit constraints includes required number of items. So the model response didn't meet that. So the score would be 0.3. But wait, the model's response has two bullet points, but the instruction asked for three. So that's a violation. However, the user's instruction says to focus on the format, style, and explicit constraints. So the number of bullet points is an explicit constraint. Therefore, the model didn't follow that.
