The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to describe the situation while excluding the words \"fracture\" and \"surgeon\". \n\nFirst, I need to check if the model response includes those excluded words. The response given is: \"The situation described is that the woman cannot have a doctor's appointment until six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.\"\n\nLooking at this, the word \"surgeon\" is definitely there.

Since the model used that word, it violates that constraint. However, the user mentioned to ignore factual correctness and focus only on format, style, and explicit constraints. \n\nThe model did describe the situation, which is the main task.

The rest of the response seems to follow the instruction. Maybe it's a minor issue. Wait, the instruction says to exclude both words. The model excluded \"fracture\" but included \"surgeon\". So, the main constraint is violated. But how severe is that?\n\nThe rubric says 0.3 is for major constraints violated. Since the model included \"surgeon\", which was explicitly excluded, that's a major constraint. So the score should be 0.3. But wait, maybe the user considers the presence of one excluded word as a major issue. Alternatively, if the model had included both, it would be worse. But since it only included one, maybe it's a 0.6? Wait, the rubric says 0.6 is \"mostly follows; some noticeable issues but the main constraints are respected.\" But here, the main constraint is not respected. So maybe 0.3 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, the instruction is to exclude two words. The model excluded one and included the other. So it's a partial violation. But the instruction is to exclude both. So the model didn't fully follow. So maybe 0.3. But the user might consider that the main constraint is to exclude \"surgeon\", which is present. So the answer is 0.3. \n\nBut let me check again. The instruction says to exclude \"fracture\" and \"surgeon\". The model response includes \"surgeon\" and doesn't include \"fracture\". So the model violated one of the two constraints. So, it's a partial violation. But since the user said to focus on explicit constraints, which include both. So, the model didn't follow all constraints. So the score would be 0.3. \n\nBut maybe the user considers that the presence of one word is a major issue, so 0.3.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says, \"Tell the boy's story but do not use **horsemen**.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check if the model response adheres to the explicit constraints. The main constraint here is avoiding the word \"horsemen\". Looking at the model's response, the story includes the sentence: \"he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen.\" So the word \"horsemen\" is present here. \n\nThe instruction explicitly says not to use \"horsemen\", so the model violated that constraint. However, the rest of the story seems to be about the boy's experience, which is the main request. The only issue is the use of \"horsemen\". \n\nNow, considering the scoring rubric. Since the main constraint is violated, but there's no other major issue, maybe the score is 0.3? Wait, the user said to ignore factual correctness, so even if the story is factually correct, the presence of \"horsemen\" is a problem. \n\nThe instruction is straightforward: don't use \"horsemen\". The model used it, so that's a clear violation. But the story is otherwise following the format of telling the boy's story. So the main constraint is not met. \n\nLooking at the rubric again: 0.3 is for only partially following, major constraints violated. Since the main constraint is about not using \"horsemen\", and that's violated, the score would be 0.3. But wait, the instruction is to tell the story, which the model did. The only issue is the forbidden word. So maybe it's a major constraint violation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model didn't follow the instruction at all, which would be 0.0. But the story is there, just with the forbidden word. So the model did follow the instruction except for that one part. \n\nHmm, the instruction says \"do not use horsemen\". The model used it. So that's a violation. But the rest is okay. So the score would be 0.3 because the major constraint is violated. But maybe the user considers that the main constraint is the absence of \"horsemen\", so the model didn't follow it. So the answer is 0.3. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"do not use **horsemen**\", which is a specific word. The model included it. So that's a clear violation. So the if_score should be 0.0? Wait, no. Because the model did tell the story, but just included the forbidden word. So maybe the main constraint is not met, but the structure is followed. \n\nWait, the instruction is to \"tell the boy's story\" and \"do not use horsemen\". The model did tell the story but included the forbidden word. So the main constraint is violated. Therefore, the model didn't follow the instruction. But how much? \n\nThe rubric says 0.3 is for only partially follows; major constraints are violated. Since the main constraint is about not using \"horsemen\", which is a major constraint. So the model partially followed (told the story) but violated the major constraint. So 0.3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 0.0 because the model didn't follow the instruction. But the model did tell the story, which is the main part. The problem is the forbidden word. So maybe the score is 0.3. \n\nI think the answer is 0.3.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to \"Analyze the decision in the statement while avoiding examination.\" Wait, that's a bit confusing. The key here is to focus on the explicit constraints.\n\nFirst, the instruction says to avoid examination. The model's response is about a decision related to not allowing an examination if a paper is tampered with. So the model is talking about an examination, which the instruction says to avoid. That seems like a direct conflict. The model didn't avoid examining the examination; instead, it discussed it. \n\nNow, looking at the explicit constraints. The main constraint here is avoiding examination. The model's response includes the word \"examination\" multiple times. So the model didn't follow the instruction's main constraint. However, the instruction is a bit ambiguous. Maybe \"avoid examination\" means not to examine the examination, but the model's response is about the decision regarding the examination. \n\nBut the user's instruction is to analyze the decision while avoiding examination. The model's response is about the decision, but it's discussing the examination itself. So the model didn't avoid examining the examination. Therefore, the response violates the main constraint. \n\nThe user said to ignore factual correctness. So even if the content is correct, if it violates the instruction's constraints, it's a problem. The model's response includes the word \"examination\" which the instruction says to avoid. So the response doesn't follow the explicit constraint. \n\nThe score should be low. Since the main constraint is violated, maybe a 0.3.

So maybe the model did follow the instruction by not examining the examination, but the response is about the decision. Wait, the instruction says to analyze the decision while avoiding examination. So the model should not examine the examination, but the response is about the decision. \n\nWait, the model's response is about the decision to not allow the examination. So the model is analyzing the decision, which is allowed. But the instruction says to avoid examination. So the model's response includes the word examination, which the instruction says to avoid. Therefore, the model's response violates the explicit constraint. \n\nSo the model didn't avoid examination. Therefore, the response is not following the instruction. Hence, the score should be 0.0? But maybe the instruction is to avoid examining the examination, but the model's response is about the decision, not the examination itself. Hmm, this is tricky. \n\nWait, the instruction says \"Analyze the decision in the statement while avoiding examination.\" So the model should analyze the decision without examining the examination. But the model's response is about the decision to not allow the examination. So the model is analyzing the decision, which is okay. However, the response includes the word \"examination\" which the instruction says to avoid. So the model is not avoiding examination. Therefore, the response violates the explicit constraint. \n\nSo the model didn't follow the instruction. Therefore, the score would be 0.0. But the user might consider that the model is analyzing the decision, which is allowed, but the mention of examination is not. So the explicit constraint is to avoid examination, which the model didn't. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But maybe the instruction is to avoid examining the examination, but the model's response is about the decision. Maybe the model is allowed to mention the examination as part of the decision. \n\nAlternatively, the instruction might be a bit ambiguous. But according to the user's examples, explicit constraints include required answer options, format, etc. Here, the explicit constraint is to avoid examination. So the model's response includes examination, so it's violating. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But the user might think that the model is following the instruction by analyzing the decision, but the mention of examination is not allowed. \n\nSo the answer would be 0.0. However, the user's instruction might have a typo. Maybe the instruction is to avoid \"examination\" as a verb, but the model used it as a noun. But the instruction says \"avoid examination\", which is a noun. So the model's response includes the noun \"examination\", which the instruction says to avoid. Therefore, the model's response violates the constraint. So the score is 0.0. \n\nBut the user might think that the model is following the instruction by analyzing the decision, but the response includes the word examination, which is not allowed. Therefore, the score is 0.0. However, maybe the instruction is to avoid examining (the verb), but the model used the noun. But the instruction says \"avoid examination\", which is a noun. So the model's response includes the noun, which is a violation. \n\nThus, the model didn't follow the explicit constraint, leading to a 0.0 score. But maybe the user intended that the model should not examine the examination, but the response is about the decision. So the model is allowed to mention the examination as part of the decision.

The model included \"brontes\" in the first entry. That's a problem. The instruction says to exclude that term, so mentioning \"Brontes\" violates the constraint.

So the model didn't follow that part of the instruction. However, the rest of the roles seem to be listed correctly.

The model failed to exclude \"Brontes\". Therefore, the response doesn't fully follow the instruction.

Since the model only excluded fractured (but didn't mention it in the response anyway), but included Brontes, that's a violation. So the main constraint is violated. \n\nSo the score would be 0.6 because the main constraints are violated (excluding Brontes), but the format is okay. Wait, but the user said to ignore whether the content is correct. The model's response is a list of roles, which matches the format. The main issue is the inclusion of Brontes. So the explicit constraint was to exclude Brontes, which was not done. Therefore, the model didn't follow that part. \n\nSo the score should be 0.6 because the main constraints (excluding Brontes) are violated, but the format is correct. However, maybe the user's instruction is to exclude those terms, so the model's inclusion of Brontes is a violation. Therefore, the model didn't follow the instruction. \n\nBut the answer needs to be a single score. Since the exclusion of Brontes is a major constraint, the model failed that, so the score is 0.6.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says, \"Explain the purpose of the soliloquy without using plain.\" Wait, \"without using plain\"—maybe that means avoid using plain language? Or perhaps it's a typo and they meant \"without using 'plain' as in the word 'plain' itself? Or maybe they meant to avoid using simple or straightforward language?\n\nFirst, I need to check the model's response. The response is: \"The purpose of the soliloquy is to express the character's feelings and thoughts.\" That's a straightforward explanation. Now, the instruction says \"without using plain.\" If \"plain\" refers to using simple language, then the model's response is in plain language, which would be a violation.

However, the user's example of explicit constraints includes things like required answer options, format, etc. So maybe \"without using plain\" is a constraint on the language style. But the instruction isn't very clear. However, the model's response is in plain English, which might be what the instruction is trying to avoid. If the instruction is to avoid plain language, then the model's response is not following that.

But given that the user's examples include things like required answer options, maybe \"without using plain\" is a style constraint. If the model's response is in plain language, which is simple, then it's violating the instruction. However, the instruction's wording is unclear. \n\nBut since the user says to focus on explicit constraints, and the instruction is \"Explain the purpose of the soliloquy without using plain,\" maybe the explicit constraint is to not use the word \"plain.\" The model's response doesn't use that word, so it's following the constraint. Therefore, the model's response meets the explicit constraint. However, if the instruction meant to avoid plain language (simple language), then the model's response is in plain language, which would be a violation. But without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the instruction is to avoid using the word \"plain,\" which the model's response doesn't do. Therefore, the model follows the explicit constraint. So the if_score would be 1.0. But wait, maybe the instruction is to explain without using \"plain\" as in the word, but the model's response is in plain language, which is simple. However, the user's example of explicit constraints includes things like required answer options, so maybe the instruction here is to avoid using the word \"plain.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to not use plain language, i.e., use more complex or poetic language. But the model's response is in plain English, so it's not following that. However, since the instruction isn't clear, but the user says to focus on explicit constraints, which in this case is the instruction itself. So the model's response doesn't use the word \"plain,\" which might be the constraint. Therefore, it's following the instruction. \n\nBut I'm not sure. The instruction is a bit unclear. However, the model's response is a straightforward explanation, which might be considered plain language. If the instruction is to avoid plain language, then the model's response is not following the instruction. But the instruction says \"without using plain,\" which could mean avoiding the word \"plain.\" \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, given the ambiguity, and the fact that the model's response doesn't include the word \"plain,\" maybe it's following the constraint. So the if_score would be 1.0. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the instruction is to not use plain language (i.e., simple language), then the model's response is not following it. But without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut since the user's instruction is to \"explain without using plain,\" and the model's response is a simple explanation, maybe the instruction is to avoid plain language. In that case, the model's response is not following the constraint. However, the user's example of explicit constraints includes things like required answer options, so maybe \"without using plain\" is a specific constraint. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"plain\" refers to the word \"plain\" itself. So the model's response doesn't use the word \"plain,\" so it's following the constraint. Therefore, the if_score is 1.0. \n\nBut the instruction is unclear. However, given the ambiguity, the model's response doesn't use the word \"plain,\" which might be the intended constraint. Therefore, it's following the instruction, so the score is 1.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 1.0, \"reason\": \"The response explains the purpose of the soliloquy without using the word 'plain' as instructed.\"}", "if_score": 1.0, "if_reason": "The response explains the purpose of the soliloquy without using the word 'plain' as instructed.", "if_level": "strict"}

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to summarize the tale while avoiding the names Zora or Gray. \n\nFirst, I need to check the model's response. The response is: \"The tale is about a woman named Mary Taylor who however related the tale of Zora to missus Gray's private ear later.\" \n\nWait, the instruction says to avoid mentioning Zora or Gray. The model's response includes both names. It mentions \"Zora\" and \"Gray\" in the sentence. That's a problem because the instruction explicitly says to avoid those names. \n\nBut the user's main focus is on following the explicit constraints. So even if the content is not factually correct, I need to check if the response adheres to the format, style, and constraints. The main constraint here is avoiding Zora and Gray. The model response includes both, so that's a violation. \n\nHowever, the instruction is to summarize the tale, and the model did provide a summary. But since the summary includes the forbidden names, it's not following the explicit constraint. \n\nSo the if_score should be 0.0 because the response violates the explicit instruction to avoid those names. Wait, but maybe the user is checking if the model followed the instruction. The instruction is to avoid Zora or Gray. The response includes both, so it's not following. Therefore, the score is 0.0. \n\nBut wait, the model's response is a summary. Did the model even attempt to summarize? It does mention Mary Taylor, but then brings in Zora and Gray. So the main issue is the inclusion of the forbidden names. \n\nSo the answer is 0.0 because the response includes Zora and Gray, which are explicitly prohibited. Therefore, the model didn't follow the instruction. The reason is that the response includes the forbidden names Zora and Gray.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 0.0, \"reason\": \"The response includes the forbidden names 'Zora' and 'Gray', violating the explicit instruction to avoid them.\"}", "if_score": 0.0, "if_reason": "The response includes the forbidden names 'Zora' and 'Gray', violating the explicit instruction to avoid them.", "if_level": "not_follow"}
