The model didn't do that, so that's a major violation. \n\nSo the model response includes owls and eagles, which violates the explicit constraint. Therefore, the score should be lower. The user's instruction says to omit those words. So the model didn't follow that. \n\nThe other parts, like the list of tuples, might not be required. The instruction didn't mention anything about the format, so maybe that's not a constraint. The main issue is the inclusion of owls and eagles. \n\nTherefore, the model didn't follow the main constraint, so the score should be 0.0? Wait, but maybe the model tried to follow the instruction but made a mistake. Let me check again. The instruction says to express the disadvantage described but omit owls and eagles. The model's response includes the part \"he had no rending claws\" which is part of the disadvantage. However, the sentence structure includes owls and eagles. \n\nSo the model didn't omit owls and eagles, which is a direct violation. So the score should be 0.0. But maybe the user's instruction is to omit those words, but the model's response includes them. Therefore, the model didn't follow the instruction. \n\nBut wait, the model's response has \"owls hawks and eagles\". So \"owls\" and \"eagles\" are present. The instruction says to omit those. Therefore, the model response violates the explicit constraint. So the score should be 0.0. But maybe there's a nuance. Let me check the rubric again. \n\nThe rubric says: 0.0 is when it doesn't follow the instruction at all. Since the model included owls and eagles, which were explicitly told to omit, that's a major violation. So the score should be 0.0. However, maybe the model tried to follow the instruction but made a mistake. But the presence of those words is a clear violation. \n\nSo the answer is 0.0. But wait, the model's response also includes the original sentences. The instruction says to express the disadvantage described. So maybe the model did that, but included the forbidden words. So the main constraint is the omission of owls and eagles. \n\nTherefore, the model didn't follow the instruction, so the score is 0.0. But the user might have other constraints. Wait, the model's response has the part \"he had no rending claws\" which is part of the disadvantage. But the instruction is to express the disadvantage, so that's okay. The problem is the mention of owls and eagles. \n\nSo the answer is 0.0. But maybe the user's instruction is to omit those words, but the model didn't. So the score is 0.0. However, the model's response includes \"owls\" and \"eagles\", which are explicitly forbidden. Therefore, the model didn't follow the instruction.

The main constraint here is not mentioning Henley or London. The response doesn't include those names at all. So that part is good. \n\nBut wait, the instruction is to provide a summary. The model's response is a direct quote from the audio. Is that a summary? Hmm, maybe not. A summary would typically be a concise overview, not a direct quote. However, the instruction might be interpreted as just needing to avoid the specific names, regardless of the format. \n\nWait, the user's instruction didn't specify the format beyond not mentioning certain names. The model's response is a direct quote, which might not be a summary. But the user's main concern here is whether the response violates the explicit constraints.

The model didn't follow the format of providing a summary. \n\nSo the explicit constraints here are: 1) provide a summary, 2) don't mention Henley or London. The model response is a direct quote, not a summary. Therefore, it violates the format constraint. \n\nBut the user's note says to focus on explicit constraints. The instruction's explicit constraints are the two mentioned. The model didn't mention Henley or London, but the response isn't a summary.

The model's response didn't use those words. So maybe the model did follow the explicit constraints. But the instruction also says to rephrase.

Therefore, the model's response followed the explicit constraints. So the if_score should be 1.0. But wait, the model's response didn't rephrase. The original complaint was \"I think I have a doctor's appointment.\" and the model's response is the same. So the model didn't rephrase. But the instruction says to rephrase. But the user's note says to focus on explicit constraints. The explicit constraints are not using \"rust\" or \"stupid\". The model's response didn't use them.

However, the model's response didn't rephrase, which might be a problem. But according to the user's note, we should ignore whether the content is correct.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to analyze the decision in the statement while avoiding examination. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe key part here is \"avoiding examination.\" So the instruction is telling the model to analyze the decision but not to examine anything. But what does that mean exactly? Maybe the instruction is a bit ambiguous, but the main point is that the model should not perform an examination as part of the analysis.\n\nLooking at the model's response: \"The decision in the statement is to not allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced.\" Hmm. The response mentions \"examination\" in the context of not allowing it. But the instruction was to avoid examination. So the model is talking about the examination being held, which seems like it's referencing the examination itself. \n\nWait, the instruction says to avoid examination. So maybe the model is supposed to not examine the statement, but the response is discussing the examination. So the model is actually referencing the examination, which might be a violation. However, the instruction is a bit unclear. If the instruction is to analyze the decision without examining the statement, then the model's response is discussing the examination, which might be a problem. \n\nBut the user's focus is on explicit constraints. The instruction here might not have explicit constraints like format, bullet points, etc. The main explicit constraint is avoiding examination. However, the model's response includes the word \"examination,\" which might be against the instruction. But the instruction is a bit vague. \n\nWait, the instruction says \"analyze the decision in the statement while avoiding examination.\" So the model is supposed to analyze the decision but not examine anything. But how does that work? Maybe the model is supposed to not perform an examination (like a test or check) while analyzing the decision.

So even if the content is wrong, we just check if it follows the format, style, and explicit constraints. \n\nIn this case, the instruction is to avoid examination. The model's response is about the examination. So it's not following the instruction. Therefore, the if_score would be low. But how low? \n\nThe instruction's explicit constraint is to avoid examination. The model's response includes examination, which is a violation. However, maybe the instruction is phrased as \"avoid examination\" meaning not to examine the statement. But the model's response is analyzing the decision, which might be allowed. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The instruction is a bit unclear. But according to the rubric, the model's response must not examine anything. The response mentions examination, so it's violating the constraint. Therefore, the score would be 0.0. But maybe the instruction is not clear enough, so the model's response is following the instruction in a way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to analyze the decision without examining the statement. The model's response is analyzing the decision, but it's talking about the examination. So maybe it's not violating the constraint. \n\nI think the instruction is to avoid examining the statement, but the model's response is discussing the examination as part of the decision. So it's following the instruction. Therefore, the if_score is 1.0. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to avoid the word \"examination\" in the response. The model's response includes \"examination,\" which would be a violation. But the instruction is not explicitly stating to avoid the word, but to avoid examination. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Given the ambiguity, maybe the model's response is following the instruction. Therefore, the score is 1.0. But I'm not certain. \n\nWait, the instruction is to \"analyze the decision in the statement while avoiding examination.\" So the model is supposed to analyze the decision but not examine anything.

The model response says, \"The character seems to be sad in the reflection. They think about Gamewell.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check if the response follows the explicit constraints. The main constraint here is avoiding the words \"twilight\" and \"Gamewell\". The response mentions \"Gamewell\", which is explicitly prohibited. So that's a violation. However, the instruction was to summarize the reflection, and the response does provide a summary. The only issue is the use of \"Gamewell\". Since the instruction is to avoid that word, including it would be a major constraint violation. \n\nThe user mentioned to ignore factual correctness, so even if the summary is accurate, the presence of the forbidden word affects the score. The response also doesn't mention \"twilight\", so that's fine. But the use of \"Gamewell\" is a problem. \n\nLooking at the rubric, a major constraint violation would lead to a lower score. The options are 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0. Since the response includes the forbidden term, it's a significant issue. However, the rest of the response does follow the instruction's main goal of summarizing the reflection. So maybe it's a 0.3? Or maybe 0.0? Wait, the instruction says to avoid those words, so using one of them is a violation. But the response is otherwise following the format. The user said to focus on format, style, and explicit constraints. The explicit constraint here is avoiding those words. The response includes \"Gamewell\", which is a direct violation. So that's a major issue. But the rest of the response is a summary. So maybe the score is 0.3 because it's only partially following. Alternatively, if the main constraint is the forbidden words, then including one of them would be a major violation. So the score would be 0.3. But the user says to look only at instruction-following. So the response didn't follow the explicit constraint of avoiding \"Gamewell\". Therefore, the if_score would be 0.3. But wait, the instruction says \"avoid twilight or Gamewell\", so the response includes \"Gamewell\", which is a direct violation. So that's a major issue. Hence, the score is 0.3. But maybe the user considers that the response is mostly following the instruction except for that one word. So maybe 0.6? Wait, the instruction is to summarize the reflection but avoid those words. The response does summarize the reflection but includes the forbidden word. So the main constraint is violated. Therefore, it's a 0.3. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check the rubric again. The rubric says 0.3 is \"only partially follows; major constraints are violated.\" Since the main constraint here is avoiding those words, and the response includes one of them, that's a major constraint violation. So the score is 0.3. So the answer would be 0.3 because the response includes \"Gamewell\", which is explicitly prohibited.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to \"recount the act of gifting but exclude shield or Montfichet.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The main ones here are to recount the act of gifting and exclude those two terms. The model's response mentions \"The act of gifting is mentioned.\" But then it adds some timestamps with <|2.94|> and <|0.83|>. Wait, the instruction didn't mention anything about timestamps or specific formatting like that. \n\nSo the response includes information that wasn't requested. The user wanted a recount of the act of gifting, but the model added timestamps which aren't part of the instruction. Also, the response doesn't actually recount the act; it just states that it's mentioned. The exclusion of \"shield\" and \"Montfichet\" isn't addressed here either. \n\nThe model didn't follow the format or style. The response is too brief and doesn't elaborate on the act of gifting as required. The timestamps are an unexpected addition. So, the main constraints are violated. The answer doesn't provide a recount, and it includes irrelevant data. \n\nTherefore, the score should be low. The user wanted a recount, but the model didn't do that. Also, the timestamps are not part of the instruction. So, maybe a 0.3 because major constraints are violated. But wait, the user said to ignore factual correctness. The model's response is not about the act of gifting but mentions it's mentioned. So, the content isn't even addressing the instruction properly. \n\nI think the score is 0.0 because the model didn't follow the instruction at all. But wait, the instruction says to \"recount the act of gifting\" which might mean to describe it, but the model just said it's mentioned. Also, the timestamps are not part of the required format. The model didn't exclude the terms, but the instruction didn't require excluding them unless they were present. Wait, the instruction says to exclude \"shield\" or \"Montfichet\" from the recount. The model's response doesn't mention those terms, so maybe that part is okay. But the main issue is that the response doesn't recount the act of gifting. Instead, it mentions that the act is mentioned with timestamps. That's not following the instruction. \n\nSo, the model didn't provide a recount, which is a major constraint. The timestamps are an additional issue. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But maybe the user wants the model to just mention the act without those terms. The model's response is not a recount but a statement about mention. So, the answer is not following the instruction. Hence, 0.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 0.0, \"reason\": \"The response does not recount the act of gifting as instructed and includes irrelevant timestamps, violating major constraints.\"}", "if_score": 0.0, "if_reason": "The response does not recount the act of gifting as instructed and includes irrelevant timestamps, violating major constraints.", "if_level": "not_follow"}

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says, \"Explain the purpose of the soliloquy without using plain.\" Wait, \"without using plain\" – maybe that means avoiding plain language?

Or perhaps they want the explanation to not be in plain English, maybe more formal or poetic?\n\nThe model response is: \"The purpose of the soliloquy is to express the speaker's anger and frustration.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check if the response adheres to the explicit constraints. The instruction's main explicit constraint is to explain the purpose without using \"plain.\" But what does that mean exactly? If \"plain\" refers to plain language, then the model's response is in standard English, which is not plain. But maybe the instruction meant to avoid using the word \"plain\" itself. Wait, the instruction says \"without using plain,\" so perhaps the model should not use the word \"plain\" in the response. However, the model's response doesn't use the word \"plain,\" so that part is okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is asking to explain the purpose without using simple or straightforward language, i.e., more elaborate. But the model's response is straightforward. However, the instruction might have been a typo, like \"without using plain text\" or \"without using plain English.\" If that's the case, the model's response is in standard English, which is not plain. But I'm not sure. \n\nBut the key here is to focus on the explicit constraints. The instruction says \"without using plain.\" If the model's response doesn't include the word \"plain,\" then that's compliant. But maybe the instruction was supposed to say \"without using plain language,\" and the model's response is in plain language. But the user's instruction is a bit ambiguous. However, the model's response is a simple explanation, which might be considered plain. \n\nBut the user's instruction says \"without using plain,\" which could mean avoiding the use of the word \"plain.\" Since the model's response doesn't use that word, it's following that constraint. However, if the intention was to avoid plain language, then the response is in plain language. But the user's instruction isn't clear. \n\nBut according to the rubric, I should focus on explicit constraints. The instruction's explicit constraint is to not use \"plain.\" The model's response doesn't use the word \"plain,\" so that's compliant. Therefore, the model follows the instruction. \n\nBut wait, maybe the instruction meant to avoid using plain English, and the model's response is in plain English. However, the user's instruction is not entirely clear. But given the ambiguity, the model's response doesn't use the word \"plain,\" so it meets the explicit constraint. Therefore, the if_score should be 1.0. \n\nBut wait, the instruction says \"without using plain,\" which might mean that the explanation should not be in plain language. If the model's response is in plain language, then it's violating the constraint. However, the user's instruction is unclear. But the model's response is a straightforward explanation, which is plain. However, the instruction's explicit constraint is to not use \"plain,\" which the model does not. So the model follows the instruction. \n\nTherefore, the if_score is 1.0. But maybe the user intended \"without using plain language,\" which the model's response does use.
