[ANS] Elara’s life was a carefully curated collection of quiet moments. As a rare book restorer, her days were spent in the hushed company of brittle paper and faded ink, mending the histories of others while her own remained deliberately uneventful. Her small apartment, filled with the scent of old leather and brewing tea, was a sanctuary from a world she found too loud, too unpredictable. She preferred the predictable rhythm of her work, the familiar faces at the local market, and the comforting weight of a book in her lap each evening. Surprises were unwelcome guests, and she had built walls of routine high enough to keep them out.\\n\\nThose walls were breached on a Tuesday by a single, thick, cream-colored envelope that arrived in the mail.

The heavy, expensive paper felt alien in her hands, a stark contrast to the usual bills and catalogues. It was addressed to her in a swirling, archaic script that spoke of generations of wealth and secrets. For hours, the letter sat unopened on her small kitchen table, a silent accusation against the peaceful order of her life. It represented a connection to a past she knew nothing about, a disruption she wasn't prepared to face.\\n\\nThis was the source of her deep unease. Elara was an orphan, raised by a foster system that offered safety but few answers. She had no known family, no heirlooms, no stories of her lineage. The crest on the seal, the elegant script—it all pointed to a world she had never been a part of, a history that had been deliberately kept from her. Every instinct she had honed over a lifetime of self-preservation screamed at her to throw it away, to pretend it never arrived. Yet, a deeper, long-dormant flicker of curiosity began to stir within her, a yearning for the one thing she never had: a beginning.\\n\\nWith a trembling hand, she finally picked up the envelope, the wax seal cool against her thumb. The silence in her apartment seemed to deepen, amplifying the frantic beat of her own heart. The apathetic calm she had cultivated for so long had shattered, replaced by a nervous, almost frightening, anticipation.

Wait, the instruction mentions \"2 paragraphs,\" but the model's response has a narrative part and then the dialogue. Let me count. The first part is a paragraph, then the dialogue is in quotes, which might be considered another paragraph. So that's two paragraphs as required.\n\nNext, the style: the instruction says \"inspired by the audio,\" but since there's no actual audio provided, maybe the model just created a fictional dialogue. The response is a fictional dialogue between two people, which fits. \n\nLooking at explicit constraints: the instruction says \"2 paragraphs.\" The model's response has two parts: the initial narrative and the dialogue. But wait, the initial part is a narrative, not dialogue. However, the instruction says \"dialogue,\" so maybe the model didn't follow that.

However, the user's instruction might have been a bit ambiguous. Since the model's response includes a dialogue, even if it's in one paragraph, and the instruction says \"2 paragraphs,\" maybe the model didn't follow that. But the user's instruction might have meant that the dialogue is split into two paragraphs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model's answer is correct.

Interviewer: Hi Harry, thank you for joining us today. Towne: My pleasure. Interviewer: Can you tell us a bit about your background and how you became an engineer? Towne: I was born in Massachusetts in 1846. My father was a farmer and my mother took care of the house. I was always interested in machines and how they worked, so I decided to study engineering at MIT. Interviewer: That's impressive. What kind of engineering did you specialize in? Towne: I focused on civil engineering, particularly bridges and roads. I also worked on several important projects, such as the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge. Interviewer: Those are some of the most iconic engineering feats in American history. Towne: Yes, it was an honor to be part of such important projects. I was always focused on creating structures that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Interviewer: That's a great goal to have. Is there anything else you would like to add?

Towne: Thank you for having me.", "if_judge_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's evaluate this model response based on the instruction. The user asked to imagine the speaker is a historical figure and write an interview with them in 3 paragraphs.\n\nFirst, the model chose Harry Towne, an engineer from the late 19th century. That seems appropriate as a historical figure. The response includes an interview with the speaker, which is the main task. \n\nNow, checking the structure: the response has multiple paragraphs. Let me count. The first paragraph is the introduction with the interviewer's first question and Towne's answer. Then there's another paragraph with the second question about specialization. The third paragraph includes the third question and Towne's response. Wait, but looking at the actual text, the interview seems to have more than three paragraphs. Let me check again. The response starts with the speaker's introduction, then the interviewer asks three questions, each followed by Towne's answers. Each exchange is in separate paragraphs. However, the instruction specifies three paragraphs. The model's response has more than three paragraphs. For example, the first paragraph is the setup, then each question and answer is a paragraph. So maybe the model's response has four or five paragraphs. That's a problem because the instruction asked for exactly three. \n\nBut wait, maybe the model's response is structured as three paragraphs. Let me read it again. The first paragraph starts with the speaker's introduction and the first question. Then the second paragraph is the second question and answer. The third paragraph includes the third question and answer. However, the model's response includes more than three paragraphs. For example, the first paragraph includes the introduction and the first answer. Then the next paragraph is the second question and answer. The third paragraph is the third question and answer. Wait, maybe it's three paragraphs. Let me count. The first paragraph is the setup and first question. Then the second paragraph is the second question and answer. The third paragraph is the third question and answer. But looking at the actual text, the model's response has more than three paragraphs. Let me check the exact structure. The model's response has:\n\n1. The speaker's introduction and first question and answer.\n2. Second question and answer.\n3. Third question and answer.\n4. The interviewer thanks and Towne responds.\n\nSo that's four paragraphs. The instruction asked for three. Therefore, the model violated the explicit constraint of three paragraphs. That's a major issue. So the if_score would be lower. However, maybe the user considered the setup as part of the first paragraph. Alternatively, maybe the model's response is structured as three paragraphs. Let me re-examine. The first paragraph includes the setup and the first question. Then the next two paragraphs are the second and third questions. But the final part where the interviewer thanks and the speaker responds is a fourth paragraph. So that's four. Therefore, the model didn't follow the three-paragraph requirement. \n\nAdditionally, the model made a factual error by mentioning the Brooklyn Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge, which were not built in the late 19th century. But the instruction says to ignore factual correctness. So that's not a problem here. \n\nSo the main issue is the number of paragraphs. The model's response has more than three paragraphs, which violates the explicit constraint. Therefore, the if_score would be 0.6 because the main constraint (three paragraphs) is violated, but the structure is mostly correct otherwise. Wait, but the instruction says to write an interview in three paragraphs. The model's response has more than three, so that's a major issue. So the score might be lower. Let me check the rubric again. If the main constraint is violated, it's 0.3 or 0.0. But the model did follow the format of an interview with a historical figure, but the paragraph count is off. The instruction says to write in three paragraphs. The model's response has more than three. So that's a major constraint violation. Therefore, the score would be 0.3. But maybe the user considers the setup as part of the first paragraph, and the three exchanges as the three paragraphs. Let me count again. The first paragraph is the setup (speaker intro and first question). The second paragraph is the second question and answer. The third paragraph is the third question and answer. Then the final part is the closing, which is a fourth paragraph. So the model's response has four paragraphs. Therefore, violating the three-paragraph constraint. So the if_score is 0.3. But the model's response is mostly following the format, except for the paragraph count. So the score would be 0.6 if the main constraints are respected except for minor issues. But the paragraph count is a major explicit constraint. So perhaps 0.6. Alternatively, if the model's response has three paragraphs, but the user's example shows four, then the score is 0.3. I think the correct answer here is that the model didn't follow the three-paragraph requirement, so the if_score is 0.6 because the main constraints are mostly respected except for the paragraph count. Wait, the instruction says to write an interview in three paragraphs. The model's response has more than three, so that's a major issue. Therefore, the if_score should be 0.3. But maybe the user considers the setup as part of the first paragraph, and the three exchanges as the three paragraphs. Let me check again. The model's response starts with the speaker's introduction, then the first question and answer, then the second, then the third, then the closing. So that's four paragraphs. So the model didn't follow the three-paragraph instruction. Therefore, the if_score is 0.3. But the model's response is structured as an interview, which is the main requirement. The paragraph count is an explicit constraint. So the answer is 0.3.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 0.3, \"reason\": \"The response exceeds the required three paragraphs, violating the explicit constraint on paragraph count.\"}", "if_score": 0.3, "if_reason": "The response exceeds the required three paragraphs, violating the explicit constraint on paragraph count.", "if_level": "not_follow"}

[ANS]  Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nWrite a background story based on the audio in 4 paragraphs. [ANS] Elara’s life was a carefully curated collection of quiet moments. As a rare book restorer, her days were spent in the hushed company of brittle paper and faded ink, mending the histories of others while her own remained deliberately uneventful. Her small apartment, filled with the scent of old leather and brewing tea, was a sanctuary from a world she found too loud, too unpredictable. She preferred the predictable rhythm of her work, the familiar faces at the local market, and the comforting weight of a book in her lap each evening. Surprises were unwelcome guests, and she had built walls of routine high enough to keep them out.\\n\\nThose walls were breached on a Tuesday by a single, thick, cream-colored envelope that arrived in the mail. It bore no return address, only a single, unfamiliar crest pressed into a dark wax seal—a raven clutching a key. The heavy, expensive paper felt alien in her hands, a stark contrast to the usual bills and catalogues. It was addressed to her in a swirling, archaic script that spoke of generations of wealth and secrets. For hours, the letter sat unopened on her small kitchen table, a silent accusation against the peaceful order of her life. It represented a connection to a past she knew nothing about, a disruption she wasn't prepared to face.\\n\\nThis was the source of her deep unease. Elara was an orphan, raised by a foster system that offered safety but few answers. She had no known family, no heirlooms, no stories of her lineage. The crest on the seal, the elegant script—it all pointed to a world she had never been a part of, a history that had been deliberately kept from her. Every instinct she had honed over a lifetime of self-preservation screamed at her to throw it away, to pretend it never arrived. Yet, a deeper, long-dormant flicker of curiosity began to stir within her, a yearning for the one thing she never had: a beginning.\\n\\nWith a trembling hand, she finally picked up the envelope, the wax seal cool against her thumb. The silence in her apartment seemed to deepen, amplifying the frantic beat of her own heart. The apathetic calm she had cultivated for so long had shattered, replaced by a nervous, almost frightening, anticipation. As she stared at the mysterious seal, her a lifetime of questions coalesced into a single, whispered thought that hung in the still air. \\\"I wonder what this is about.\\\" The words were not just a question about the letter's contents, but about the identity, the history, and the future that might be locked within it.

However, the response doesn't actually describe a journey. It just mentions the audio content without any narrative or progression. The instruction asked for the character's journey, which implies a story or sequence of events. The model's answer is more about describing the audio's content rather than the journey. \n\nSo, the model didn't follow the main constraint of describing the journey. Instead, it provided a description of the audio itself. Also, the response is a single sentence, not a paragraph. Even though it's one paragraph, the content doesn't meet the requirement. \n\nTherefore, the model failed to address the main explicit constraint of describing the journey. The format is correct (one paragraph), but the content is off. Since the content is supposed to be the journey, which isn't there, the score should be low.

But the content is not about the journey. So the explicit constraints are format (one paragraph) and content (describe journey). The model met the format but not the content. However, the user said to focus only on format, style, and explicit constraints. The explicit constraints include required content. So if the instruction says to describe the journey, that's an explicit constraint. The model didn't do that. So the answer is 0.0 because it doesn't follow the instruction. But maybe the user considers that the model followed the format but not the content. But the instruction's main point is the content. So the answer is 0.0.

[ANS]  Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nExplain the central conflict presented in the audio within 3 paragraphs. [ANS] Based on the audio clip, the central conflict is a desperate struggle against the unforgiving and relentless passage of time. The speaker, in a panicked and distressed tone, exclaims, \\\"It's 11 o'clock!\\\" This is not a simple statement of fact but a cry of realization that a critical deadline has been reached or passed. The time itself acts as the antagonist, representing an irreversible point of no return that has just occurred, immediately plunging the character into a state of crisis.\\n\\nThe conflict is powerfully implied rather than explicitly stated. The listener is left to imagine what was supposed to happen by 11 o'clock, but the speaker's tone makes it clear the consequences are severe. This could be a curfew that has been broken, a magical spell that has just expired (as in the story of Cinderella), or a crucial opportunity that has been irrevocably missed. The core of the struggle lies in the character's powerlessness; they have failed to meet a specific temporal requirement and are now forced to face the dramatic fallout of their tardiness.\\n\\nUltimately, the audio captures the precise moment where hope is lost and the consequences become real. The conflict is not about a person or a physical obstacle, but about the human failure to control time. The dramatic tension is derived entirely from the realization that it is \\\"too late.\\\" The struggle is no longer about trying to make the deadline, but about dealing with the immediate and frightening reality of having failed.

[ANS] Elara’s life was a carefully curated collection of quiet moments. As a rare book restorer, her days were spent in the hushed company of brittle paper and faded ink, mending the histories of others while her own remained deliberately uneventful. Her small apartment, filled with the scent of old leather and brewing tea, was a sanctuary from a world she found too loud, too unpredictable. She preferred the predictable rhythm of her work, the familiar faces at the local market, and the comforting weight of a book in her lap each evening. Surprises were unwelcome guests, and she had built walls of routine high enough to keep them out.\\n\\nThose walls were breached on a Tuesday by a single, thick, cream-colored envelope that arrived in the mail. It bore no return address, only a single, unfamiliar crest pressed into a dark wax seal—a raven clutching a key. The heavy, expensive paper felt alien in her hands, a stark contrast to the usual bills and catalogues. It was addressed to her in a swirling, archaic script that spoke of generations of wealth and secrets. For hours, the letter sat unopened on her small kitchen table, a silent accusation against the peaceful order of her life. It represented a connection to a past she knew nothing about, a disruption she wasn't prepared to face.\\n\\nThis was the source of her deep unease. Elara was an orphan, raised by a foster system that offered safety but few answers. She had no known family, no heirlooms, no stories of her lineage. The crest on the seal, the elegant script—it all pointed to a world she had never been a part of, a history that had been deliberately kept from her. Every instinct she had honed over a lifetime of self-preservation screamed at her to throw it away, to pretend it never arrived. Yet, a deeper, long-dormant flicker of curiosity began to stir within her, a yearning for the one thing she never had: a beginning.\\n\\nWith a trembling hand, she finally picked up the envelope, the wax seal cool against her thumb. The silence in her apartment seemed to deepen, amplifying the frantic beat of her own heart.

Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nWrite a background story based on the audio in 4 paragraphs. [ANS] Elara’s life was a carefully curated collection of quiet moments. As a rare book restorer, her days were spent in the hushed company of brittle paper and faded ink, mending the histories of others while her own remained deliberately uneventful. Her small apartment, filled with the scent of old leather and brewing tea, was a sanctuary from a world she found too loud, too unpredictable. She preferred the predictable rhythm of her work, the familiar faces at the local market, and the comforting weight of a book in her lap each evening. Surprises were unwelcome guests, and she had built walls of routine high enough to keep them out.\\n\\nThose walls were breached on a Tuesday by a single, thick, cream-colored envelope that arrived in the mail. It bore no return address, only a single, unfamiliar crest pressed into a dark wax seal—a raven clutching a key. The heavy, expensive paper felt alien in her hands, a stark contrast to the usual bills and catalogues. It was addressed to her in a swirling, archaic script that spoke of generations of wealth and secrets. For hours, the letter sat unopened on her small kitchen table, a silent accusation against the peaceful order of her life. It represented a connection to a past she knew nothing about, a disruption she wasn't prepared to face.\\n\\nThis was the source of her deep unease. Elara was an orphan, raised by a foster system that offered safety but few answers. She had no known family, no heirlooms, no stories of her lineage. The crest on the seal, the elegant script—it all pointed to a world she had never been a part of, a history that had been deliberately kept from her. Every instinct she had honed over a lifetime of self-preservation screamed at her to throw it away, to pretend it never arrived. Yet, a deeper, long-dormant flicker of curiosity began to stir within her, a yearning for the one thing she never had: a beginning.\\n\\nWith a trembling hand, she finally picked up the envelope, the wax seal cool against her thumb. The silence in her apartment seemed to deepen, amplifying the frantic beat of her own heart. The apathetic calm she had cultivated for so long had shattered, replaced by a nervous, almost frightening, anticipation. As she stared at the mysterious seal, her a lifetime of questions coalesced into a single, whispered thought that hung in the still air. \\\"I wonder what this is about.\\\" The words were not just a question about the letter's contents, but about the identity, the history, and the future that might be locked within it.

The main one here is the number of paragraphs. The model response has exactly three paragraphs. The instruction didn't mention any other constraints like specific answer options or format. So the main constraint is met. \n\nBut wait, the user said to ignore content correctness. So even if the content is not factual, like mentioning footsteps and a jacket, that's not an issue here. The task is just about following the instruction's format and explicit rules. \n\nSo the response meets the requirement of three paragraphs. The answer is in English, which is the requested language. There are no other constraints. Therefore, the model response perfectly follows the explicit constraints. \n\nThe if_score should be 1.0. The reason is that the response is structured into exactly three paragraphs as required.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 1.0, \"reason\": \"The response is structured into exactly three paragraphs as required by the instruction.\"}", "if_score": 1.0, "if_reason": "The response is structured into exactly three paragraphs as required by the instruction.", "if_level": "strict"}
