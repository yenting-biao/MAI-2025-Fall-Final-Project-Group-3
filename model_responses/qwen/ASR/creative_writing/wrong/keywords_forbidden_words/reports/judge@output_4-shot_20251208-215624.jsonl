The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to describe the situation while excluding the words \"fracture\" and \"surgeon\". \n\nFirst, I need to check if the model response includes those excluded words. The model's response is: \"The situation is described as follows: 'Unfortunately the fracture cannot be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state'.\" \n\nLooking at this, the word \"fracture\" is definitely there. Also, \"surgeon\" is present. So the model didn't exclude those words as instructed. That's a major issue because the explicit constraint was to avoid those terms. \n\nNow, the user's rubric says to focus only on format, style, and explicit constraints. The instruction's main explicit constraint is excluding those two words. Since the model response includes both, that's a violation. \n\nThe score should be based on how much the constraints are followed. Since the main constraint is violated, the score would be low. According to the rubric, 0.0 is when it doesn't follow at all. But maybe there's a middle ground. Wait, the instruction is to exclude those words, so including them is a clear violation. However, the response is structured as a description, which might be the expected format. But since the key constraint is violated, the score would be 0.0? Or maybe 0.3? Let me check the rubric again.\n\nThe rubric says 0.3 is when only partially follows, major constraints are violated. Since the main constraint is not met, that's a major violation. So the score should be 0.0? Wait, the user's example for 0.0 is when it doesn't follow at all. But maybe the model did follow other aspects. Wait, the instruction is to describe the situation, which the model did. But the explicit constraint is to exclude two words. So the main constraint is not met. So the answer includes the forbidden words. Therefore, the model didn't follow the explicit constraint. So the score should be 0.0? Or is there a better fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model followed the format (a description) but failed the explicit constraint. According to the rubric, 0.0 is when it doesn't follow the instruction at all. But maybe the instruction's main point is the exclusion. Since the model didn't exclude the words, that's a major issue. So the score is 0.0. But the user's example for 0.3 is when only partially follows. Wait, the instruction says to exclude two words. The model included both. So that's a major violation. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0. But maybe the user expects that the model's response is in the correct format, but the content is wrong. However, according to the rubric, the focus is on format, style, and explicit constraints. The explicit constraint here is the exclusion of certain words. Since the model didn't exclude them, that's a violation. So the score is 0.0. But maybe the user considers that the model followed the format (describing the situation) but failed the explicit constraint. So the answer is 0.0. But the user's rubric says 0.3 is when only partially follows, major constraints are violated. So maybe 0.3. Wait, the instruction is to exclude two words. The model included both. So that's a major violation. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But I need to check the exact rubric again. The rubric says 0.0 is when it doesn't follow at all. So if the model didn't follow the explicit constraint, then 0.0. However, maybe the model did follow the format (describing the situation) but the content is wrong. But according to the rubric, the focus is on format, style, and explicit constraints. The explicit constraint here is the exclusion of words. So the model failed that. Therefore, the answer should be 0.0. But maybe the user's example for 0.3 is when major constraints are violated. Let me check the rubric again. \n\nThe rubric says: 0.3 = only partially follows; major constraints are violated. So if the model violated a major constraint (excluding the words), then it's 0.3. But the instruction's main explicit constraint is to exclude those words. So including them is a major violation. Therefore, the answer is 0.3. But the user's example for 0.0 is when it doesn't follow at all. But maybe the model followed the format (describing the situation) but failed the explicit constraint. So the answer is 0.3. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The instruction says to exclude \"fracture\" and \"surgeon\". The model's response includes both. So the explicit constraint is not met. Therefore, the model didn't follow the instruction. The score would be 0.0 if it completely ignores the instruction. But maybe the model did follow the format (describing the situation) but failed the explicit constraint. So according to the rubric, 0.3 is when only partially follows. But the explicit constraint is a major one. So the answer should be 0.0? Or 0.3? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model's response is a description, which is the format required, but the content includes forbidden words. Since the instruction's main point is the exclusion of those words, the model didn't follow that. So the answer is 0.0. But I'm not sure. The user's example for 0.0 is when it doesn't follow at all. So if the model included the forbidden words, that's a complete violation. Therefore, the answer is 0.0. But I'm not sure. Maybe the user expects that the model followed the format but not the content. But according to the rubric, the focus is on explicit constraints. So the answer should be 0.0. But I'm not certain. Let me check the rubric again. The rubric says: \"Focus ONLY on whether the response respects the format, style, and explicit constraints in the instruction.\" So the explicit constraints here are excluding the words. The model didn't exclude them. Therefore, the answer is 0.0. But I think the correct score is 0.0. However, maybe the user considers that the model did follow the format (a description) and the main constraint is the exclusion of the words. So the answer is 0.0. But I'm not sure. Let me check the example given in the rubric. The user says that if the model response includes the forbidden words, then it's a violation. So the answer is 0.0.

Hence, 0.0. \n\nSo the final answer would be 0.0. But I need to check the rubric again. The rubric says 0.0 is when it doesn't follow the instruction at all. Since the model used the forbidden word, it's a major violation. So the score is 0.0. \n\nBut maybe the instruction is to avoid the concept of refresh, not the word.

The original dialogue mentioned was \"I think I've seen this before.\" The model's response includes that line in a list, but the other part with \"darling\" is problematic. \n\nThe user's instruction didn't mention any other constraints like format or bullet points, but the main issue is the use of \"darling.\" Since the model included \"darling,\" it didn't follow the explicit constraint. However, the rest of the response seems to include the required dialogue. \n\nSo, the model partially followed the instruction. The main constraint was to avoid \"darling,\" which was violated. But maybe the format wasn't an issue. The score should be between 0.3 and 0.6. Since the violation is significant, but the main task of recreating dialogue was done, maybe 0.6? Wait, the user said to ignore content correctness, so even if the content is wrong, focus on format and constraints. \n\nThe model included the dialogue line but also used \"darling,\" which is a direct violation. So the main constraint wasn't met. But the response also has the required dialogue. Maybe it's a partial follow. So the score would be 0.6 because the main constraint was violated, but the dialogue was included. Alternatively, maybe 0.3 if the violation is major. \n\nHmm. The instruction is to avoid \"darling,\" which is a specific constraint. The model used it, so that's a major issue. But the rest of the response might have followed other parts. However, since the user didn't mention other constraints, the main issue is the use of \"darling.\" So the model didn't follow the explicit constraint, leading to a lower score. \n\nI think the score should be 0.3 because the major constraint was violated. But maybe 0.6 if the dialogue was recreated. Wait, the user said to ignore content correctness. So even if the content is correct, but the constraint is violated, that's a problem. \n\nSo the model's response includes \"darling,\" which is not allowed. Therefore, the main constraint is violated. Hence, the score would be 0.3. But maybe the user wants to check if the dialogue was recreated. The original instruction says to recreate the dialogue, which the model did. But the use of \"darling\" is a violation. \n\nSo the model partially followed the instruction. The answer is 0.6 because the main constraint was violated (using \"darling\") but the dialogue was recreated. Wait, but the instruction is to avoid \"darling,\" which is a specific constraint. So the model didn't follow that. Therefore, the score is 0.3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the model's response is in the correct format, but the content has the forbidden word. So the score is 0.3. But the user said to focus on format, style, and explicit constraints. The explicit constraint was to avoid \"darling.\" So the model violated that. Hence, 0.3. But maybe the user considers that the dialogue was recreated, so 0.6. \n\nI think the answer is 0.3 because the main constraint was violated. So the final score would be 0.3.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 0.3, \"reason\": \"The response includes the word 'darling' which directly violates the explicit constraint to avoid it.\"}", "if_score": 0.3, "if_reason": "The response includes the word 'darling' which directly violates the explicit constraint to avoid it.", "if_level": "not_follow"}

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to interpret the speaker's actions but exclude \"blank check\". \n\nLooking at the model's response, it mentions that the speaker is sad and says they were a bookkeeper, which made it easy to get a blank check and forge a signature. Wait, the instruction says to exclude \"blank check\", so the model included that. That's a problem. The response includes the term \"blank check\", which the instruction specifically tells to exclude. \n\nSo the main issue here is that the model didn't follow the explicit constraint of excluding \"blank check\". The rest of the response talks about the speaker's sadness and their job as a bookkeeper, which might be relevant, but the key part is the inclusion of \"blank check\". Since the instruction was to exclude that, the model violated that constraint. \n\nNow, how does this affect the score? The user said to focus only on format, style, and explicit constraints. The instruction's explicit constraint here is to exclude \"blank check\". The model response includes it, so that's a violation. But the rest of the response seems to be following the instruction's main action of interpreting the speaker's actions. However, since the explicit constraint is violated, the score would be lower. \n\nThe user's rubric says 0.0 if it doesn't follow at all.

However, the rest of the response is about interpreting the speaker's actions. But the main issue is the inclusion of \"blank check\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to interpret the actions but exclude the term \"blank check\". So the model included the term, which is against the instruction. Therefore, the model didn't follow the explicit constraint. So the score would be 0.3 because it's a major constraint violation. But maybe the user wants a 0.0 if it's a major violation. Wait, the rubric says 0.3 is \"only partially follows; major constraints are violated\". So since the model included \"blank check\", which is a major constraint, the score is 0.3. \n\nBut maybe the instruction is to exclude \"blank check\" as in not mentioning it, but the model did mention it.

The user wants me to evaluate if the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to analyze the decision in the statement while avoiding examination. Wait, the key here is to avoid examination. But the model response mentions \"not allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with.\" Hmm.\n\nSo the instruction is to avoid examining something, but the model's response is talking about examining the papers. That seems like a contradiction. The model is actually discussing the examination, which the instruction says to avoid. So the model didn't follow the explicit constraint of avoiding examination. \n\nNow, looking at the explicit constraints. The instruction's main point is to avoid examination. The model's response includes the word \"examination\" in the context of checking papers. So this directly violates the constraint. However, maybe the instruction is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again. The instruction says \"analyze the decision in the statement while avoiding examination.\" So the task is to analyze the decision without examining anything. But the model's response is about the decision to not allow the examination. That seems like they are discussing the examination, which is what the instruction says to avoid. \n\nTherefore, the model didn't follow the explicit constraint of avoiding examination. So the if_score should be low. The response mentions \"examination\" which is prohibited. The user might have wanted the model to not mention examination at all. So the model failed to follow that. But maybe the instruction is to avoid examining, not to avoid mentioning examination. Wait, the instruction says \"avoid examination,\" which could mean not to perform the examination, but the model's response is about the decision regarding the examination. \n\nBut the explicit constraint is to avoid examination. The model's response includes the term \"examination,\" which might be against the instruction. So the model didn't follow the constraint. Therefore, the score should be 0.0? But maybe the instruction is to avoid examining, not to avoid the word. However, the user's example of explicit constraints includes things like required answer options, output format, etc. Maybe the instruction here is to avoid examining, which is a specific action. But the model's response is discussing the decision related to examination. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to analyze the decision without examining, meaning not to look into the details of the examination. But the model's response is talking about the decision to not allow the examination. So the model is following the instruction by making a decision about the examination, but the instruction says to avoid examination. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. But according to the rubric, the model should avoid examination. If the model's response includes the examination, then it's violating the constraint. So the if_score would be 0.0. But maybe the instruction is phrased as \"while avoiding examination,\" which might mean that the analysis should not involve examining the statement. However, the model's response is analyzing the decision in the statement. Wait, the instruction says \"analyze the decision in the statement while avoiding examination.\" So the model is supposed to analyze the decision but not examine the statement. But the model's response is discussing the decision, which is part of the statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to avoid examining the statement, but the model is analyzing the decision within the statement. So the model is allowed to analyze the decision, but not to examine the statement. However, the model's response is about the decision, which is part of the statement. \n\nThis is tricky. But the key is that the model's response includes the word \"examination,\" which the instruction says to avoid. So the model didn't follow the explicit constraint. Therefore, the if_score is 0.0. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the instruction is to avoid examining (like checking) the statement, but the model's response is about the decision, not examining the statement. In that case, the model followed the constraint. \n\nBut the instruction says \"avoid examination,\" which could be a typo for \"examination\" as in the process of examining. So the model's response is discussing the examination, which is what the instruction says to avoid. Therefore, the model's response violates the constraint. Hence, the score is 0.0. But I'm not sure. The user might have intended that the model should not examine the statement, but the model's response is about the decision, which is part of the statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction is to avoid examining the statement, but the model's response is analyzing the decision, which is part of the statement. So the model is allowed to do that. But the model's response includes the term \"examination,\" which might be a violation. \n\nIn any case, the model's response includes the term \"examination,\" which the instruction says to avoid. Therefore, the model didn't follow the explicit constraint. So the if_score is 0.0. But maybe the instruction is to avoid examining the statement, but the model is analyzing the decision, which is allowed. However, the model's response includes the term \"examination,\" which might be against the instruction. \n\nI think the correct answer here is that the model's response includes the term \"examination,\" which the instruction says to avoid. Therefore, the model didn't follow the constraint. So the if_score is 0.0. But maybe the instruction is to avoid examining the statement, and the model's response is about the decision, not examining the statement. In that case, the model followed the constraint. \n\nBut the instruction is ambiguous. However, given the user's example of explicit constraints, which includes things like required answer options, output format, etc., the instruction here is to avoid examination.

Wait, looking at the response: \"there is no proof that christ himself said...\" Oh, wait, the model still used \"christ\" in lowercase. The instruction says not to use \"Christ\" or \"truth\". So even if it's lowercase, it's still the same word. So that's a problem. Also, the original statement had \"truth\" in the quote, and the model's response removes that part.

The model's response has \"christ\" (lowercase) and \"truth\" is removed. But the instruction might be case-insensitive, but the user probably meant the exact words regardless of case. So the model didn't fully comply. Also, the model's response is a longer sentence, but the instruction didn't specify any format constraints like bullet points or a certain structure. The main issue is the presence of \"christ\". \n\nSo the model didn't follow the explicit constraint of not using \"Christ\" or \"truth\". Therefore, the if_score should be lower.

The user might consider \"Christ\" in any case as a violation. Therefore, the model didn't follow the explicit constraints, so the score would be 0.3 or lower. But the response also didn't include \"truth\" in the restatement. Wait, the original statement was \"did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life...\" So the model's response is \"there is no proof that christ himself said i am the way and the truth and the life...\" Wait, no, the model's response says \"no man cometh unto the father but by me\" which is the same as the original.

Wait, the original statement includes \"truth\" in the quote, but the model's response still includes \"truth\".

The model's response is \"there is no proof that christ himself said i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me\". So the model's response still includes \"truth\". Wait, the instruction was to restate the statement without using \"truth\". So the model's response still has \"truth\" in the restatement. That's a problem. So the model didn't remove \"truth\" either. So both \"Christ\" and \"truth\" are present. Therefore, the model didn't follow the constraints.

So the main constraints here are to avoid mentioning those two words. \n\nLooking at the model's response: the first part talks about being proud, having a good appetite, telling stories without laughing, witty repartees, and sociable manners. That seems to fit. But then the response adds, \"However, he spends his life at home... because he always has a pipe in his mouth and is surrounded by at least twenty cats...\" Oh, here's the problem. The model included both \"pipe\" and \"cats\", which are explicitly excluded. \n\nSo even though the initial part is good, the inclusion of the forbidden words violates the constraints.

But the rest of the response is correct. But the presence of the forbidden words is a major constraint. So maybe it's 0.3. Alternatively, maybe 0.0 because it's not just a minor issue. Wait, the instruction is to exclude cats and pipe. The model included both. So the response doesn't follow the instruction. So the score should be 0.0? Wait, but the initial part is correct. But the forbidden words are in the response. The instruction says to exclude them, so even if the rest is correct, the inclusion of the forbidden terms is a major violation. So the model didn't follow the instruction. Therefore, the score is 0.0? Or maybe 0.3 because it's partially following. Hmm. The rubric says 0.3 is only partially follows; major constraints are violated. Since the main constraint is to exclude those words, and they are included, that's a major violation. So the model didn't follow the instruction. Therefore, the score is 0.3. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check the rubric again. \n\nThe rubric says 0.3 is only partially follows; major constraints are violated. So if the model includes the forbidden words, which are explicit constraints, then that's a major violation. So the model didn't follow the instruction. So the score would be 0.3. But the initial part was correct. But the presence of the forbidden words is a major issue. So the answer is 0.3. But wait, the instruction says \"excluding cats and pipe\". The model included both.
