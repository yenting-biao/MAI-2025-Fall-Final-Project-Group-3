That seems contradictory. But the user's instruction is to not mention \"whale\" at all. \n\nWait, the model's response actually does mention \"whale\" in the word \"whale\" itself. The instruction says not to mention \"whale\", so the model's response is violating that. However, the user's instruction is to react to the statement but not mention \"whale\". The model's response is pointing out that the statement doesn't contain \"whale\", which is a contradiction because the original statement does have \"whale\" in it. But the main point here is whether the model mentioned \"whale\" in its response. \n\nThe model's response does mention \"whale\" in the word \"whale\" in the sentence. So that's a violation of the instruction. However, the user's instruction is to not mention \"whale\" at all. The model's response is incorrect in its content, but the user's instruction is about following the format and constraints. Wait, but the user said to ignore whether the content is factually correct. So even if the model's response is wrong, I should check if it follows the explicit constraints. \n\nThe explicit constraint here is not to mention \"whale\". The model's response does mention \"whale\" in the word \"whale\", so it's violating that. Therefore, the model didn't follow the instruction. But the user's instruction is to react to the statement but not mention \"whale\". The model's response is a reaction, but it mentions \"whale\", which is not allowed. \n\nSo the if_score should be 0.0 because it violates the explicit constraint of not mentioning \"whale\". But wait, the model's response is pointing out that the statement doesn't contain \"whale\", which is a fact. However, the instruction is to not mention \"whale\" in the response.

So even if the model's response is factually incorrect (the statement does contain \"whale\"), we should focus on the explicit constraints. The explicit constraint is not to mention \"whale\". The model's response does mention \"whale\", so it's violating the instruction. Therefore, the score should be 0.0. \n\nBut maybe the model's response is correct in the content. Wait, the original statement is \"there is a whale a whale cried the professor\". The model's response says it doesn't contain the word \"whale\". But the statement does have \"whale\" twice. So the model's content is incorrect, but the user said to ignore that. So the focus is on the format and constraints.

Therefore, the score is 0.0. But maybe the user considers that the model's answer is in the correct format (a description), but the content violates the constraints. So the answer is 0.0. \n\nBut the rubric says 0.3 is when major constraints are violated. Wait, the instruction's explicit constraints are avoiding the words. The model included both, which are major constraints. So the answer is 0.0? Or 0.3? The rubric says 0.3 is when only partially follows, major constraints violated.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to explain the event but not mention \"explosion\". The model response is \"The event is 'then came the explosion'.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the explicit constraints. The main constraint here is not using the word \"explosion\". The model's response includes the exact phrase \"the explosion\", which directly violates the instruction. Even though the user might have meant to avoid the word, the response explicitly mentions it. \n\nNow, looking at the scoring rubric. Since the response violates a key constraint by including the forbidden word, that's a major issue. The score should be low. The options are 0.0 to 1.0. Since the model didn't follow the main instruction, it's not 1.0 or 0.8. It's either 0.3 or 0.0. But the response does attempt to explain the event, so maybe it's not completely off. However, the explicit violation is significant. The instruction is clear, so the model's response fails. I think 0.0 is appropriate because it directly mentions the forbidden term, which is a major constraint violation. But wait, the instruction says not to mention \"explosion\", but the response includes it. So the main constraint is violated. Therefore, the score should be 0.0. But maybe the user considers that the model tried to explain the event, so maybe 0.3? Wait, the instruction is to explain the event without mentioning explosion. The response is just stating the event as \"then came the explosion\", which includes the forbidden word. So the model didn't follow the instruction. Hence, the score is 0.0. But maybe the user thinks that the model didn't mention explosion in the explanation, but the event itself is named with explosion. Hmm. The instruction says \"explain the event but do not mention explosion\". The model's response is stating the event as \"then came the explosion\", which includes the word. So the model did mention explosion, which is a direct violation. Therefore, the score should be 0.0. But maybe the user is looking for whether the explanation itself avoids the word. However, the model's response is just stating the event, not explaining it. So the model didn't explain the event properly. Wait, the instruction says \"explain the event\", but the response is just stating the event. So the model didn't explain it, which is another issue. But the main constraint is not mentioning explosion. So the model's response violates the main constraint by including the word explosion. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But maybe the user considers that the model didn't mention explosion in the explanation, but the event itself is named. However, the instruction says not to mention explosion, regardless of context. So the model's response includes the word, which is a violation. Therefore, the score is 0.0. But the user might have intended that the model should not use the word in the explanation. So the model's response includes the word in the event's name, which is part of the explanation. Therefore, it's a violation. Hence, the score is 0.0. So the final answer is 0.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 0.0, \"reason\": \"The response explicitly mentions 'explosion', which directly violates the instruction to avoid using the term.\"}", "if_score": 0.0, "if_reason": "The response explicitly mentions 'explosion', which directly violates the instruction to avoid using the term.", "if_level": "not_follow"}

Maybe the model is supposed to not examine the decision, but the response is about the decision. \n\nBut the model's response includes \"examination\" in the sentence. So if the instruction is to avoid using the term \"examination,\" then the model's response is violating that. However, if the instruction is to avoid the act of examining, but the model is discussing the decision, then maybe it's okay. \n\nBut the user's example of explicit constraints includes things like required answer options, output format, etc. The instruction here is to avoid examination. So if the model's response includes the word \"examination,\" that's a violation. However, the instruction might be ambiguous. \n\nIn this case, the model's response does mention \"examination,\" which is part of the instruction's constraint to avoid. Therefore, the model's response is violating the explicit constraint.

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to describe the influence of the object while avoiding the words \"evil\" or \"bewildered\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the model's response. The response is: \"The object is mentioned in the sentence 'That is exactly what happened.'\". \n\nSo, the main points here are: the model is describing the influence of the object, but it's just stating that the object is mentioned in a sentence. The instruction didn't specify any particular format, like a list or bullet points. It also didn't mention any answer options or required structure. The only explicit constraints are avoiding the two specific words.\n\nNow, the model's response doesn't use \"evil\" or \"bewildered\", so that part is good. But the instruction says \"describe the influence\", which implies more than just mentioning the object. The response is very brief and doesn't elaborate on the influence. However, the instruction didn't specify the length or depth of the description. \n\nSince there are no explicit constraints about the length or depth, the model just needs to avoid the forbidden words. The response does that. But maybe the instruction is a bit ambiguous. If the user expected a more detailed description of the influence, then the model's answer is too short. However, the problem says to ignore content relevance and factual correctness. So even if the answer is too short, as long as it meets the explicit constraints, it's okay. \n\nWait, the instruction says \"describe the influence of the object\". The model's answer doesn't mention the influence at all. It just says the object is mentioned in a sentence. That's a problem. Because the main task is to describe the influence, but the response doesn't do that. However, the user's note says to focus only on explicit constraints. The instruction's explicit constraints are avoiding certain words. The model didn't use those words, so that's good. But the instruction's main task is to describe the influence, which the model didn't do. \n\nBut according to the guidelines, I should focus on explicit constraints, not on whether the content is correct or relevant. So even if the answer doesn't address the influence, if it meets the explicit constraints (no evil or bewildered), then it's okay. \n\nWait, the instruction says \"describe the influence of the object while avoiding evil or bewildered\". So the explicit constraints here are avoiding those two words. The model's response doesn't use them, so that's good. The main task is to describe the influence, but the user says to ignore content relevance. So even if the answer is not descriptive enough, as long as the constraints are met, it's okay. \n\nBut the model's answer is just a statement that the object is mentioned in a sentence. It doesn't describe the influence. So maybe the model didn't follow the instruction's main task. But the user says to ignore content relevance. So perhaps the answer is acceptable. \n\nHmm. The user's instruction says to focus on format, style, and explicit constraints. The explicit constraints are avoiding those two words. The model's response doesn't use them, so that's good. The format isn't specified, so the model's answer is in a sentence, which is acceptable. \n\nTherefore, the model follows the explicit constraints. So the if_score should be 1.0. But wait, maybe the instruction's main task is to describe the influence, which the model didn't do. But according to the user's note, we should ignore whether the content is correct or relevant. So even if the answer is not descriptive, as long as it meets the explicit constraints, it's okay. \n\nTherefore, the score is 1.0. But maybe the user considers that the model didn't describe the influence, which is part of the instruction. However, the user says to ignore content relevance. So the answer is okay. So the if_score is 1.0.\n</think>\n\n{\"if_score\": 1.0, \"reason\": \"The response avoids the explicit forbidden words 'evil' and 'bewildered' as required by the instruction.\"}", "if_score": 1.0, "if_reason": "The response avoids the explicit forbidden words 'evil' and 'bewildered' as required by the instruction.", "if_level": "strict"}

The user wants me to grade how well the model response follows the instruction. The instruction says to \"Recount the act of gifting but exclude shield or Montfichet.\" So the main points here are: recounting the act of gifting, and making sure that the words \"shield\" and \"Montfichet\" are excluded.\n\nLooking at the model response, it starts by saying, \"The act of gifting is mentioned.\" That part seems to address the first part of the instruction. But then it goes on to mention the timings of \"shield\" and \"Montfichet\" in the text. Wait, the instruction says to exclude those words, so including their timings would be a problem. \n\nSo the model response actually includes information about \"shield\" and \"Montfichet,\" which violates the exclusion constraint. Even though the first part mentions the act of gifting, the inclusion of those two words (with their timings) is against the instruction. Therefore, the response doesn't fully follow the explicit constraints. \n\nNow, considering the scoring rubric. Since the main constraint is to exclude those words, and the model response includes them, that's a major violation. But the first part about the act of gifting is correct. However, the inclusion of the excluded terms is a significant issue. So the score would be 0.3 because the major constraints are violated. But wait, maybe there's more. The instruction says to \"recount the act of gifting,\" which the model does in the first sentence. But then they add the timings of the excluded words, which isn't part of the recount. So maybe that's an extra detail that's not needed. \n\nBut the instruction's explicit constraint is to exclude those words. The model response includes them, which is a direct violation. So even though the first part is correct, the inclusion of the excluded terms is a major issue. Therefore, the score is 0.3. Alternatively, if the model's response is structured in a way that the exclusion is not followed, then the score is 0.3. But maybe the model is just providing timings, which is not part of the recount. However, the instruction says to exclude those words, so including their timings is not allowed. So the response doesn't follow the constraints.
