A slight, wistful smile touched the corners of his mouth as he considered the possibility. \\\"I hope so,\\\" he said, his voice softer than before. \\\"Cold weather always makes me think of our first winter here, when we'd huddle on the couch with that scratchy wool blanket.\\\" He finally set the paper down, giving his full attention, a nostalgic warmth in his eyes that defied any coming chill.

There is an undercurrent of concern or mild worry in her voice, suggesting she anticipates the subject matter to be serious or unpleasant.
