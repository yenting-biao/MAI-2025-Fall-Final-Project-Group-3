The principle states that a change in a magnetic field induces an electrical current in a conductor, which can be measured and used to determine the size of the magnetic field. One of the most well-known applications of this principle is the index strain, which is used to measure the strain in a material caused by changes in temperature or pressure. This is particularly useful in the field of civil engineering, where it is used to monitor the integrity of bridges, buildings, and other structures. The index strain is a simple and reliable method for measuring strain, and its widespread use has helped to ensure the safety and stability of many important structures around the world."}
