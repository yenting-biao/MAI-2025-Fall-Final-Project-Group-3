Mr. Jenkins welcomed him with open arms and offered him a seat on the porch. They talked for hours about everything under the sun. Timmy learned that Mr. Jenkins was a retired musician and loved to play the piano. He also loved to cook and often invited Timmy over for dinner. They became fast friends and would spend hours playing music, cooking, and talking. Timmy felt like he had found a new home with Mr. Jenkins. He would visit him every day and they would have the best time together. They laughed and joked and shared stories. Mr. Jenkins became like a father figure to Timmy. One day, Mr. Jenkins passed away, but Timmy never forgot him. He always remembered the happy times they spent together and the lessons he learned from him.
