Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nDetermine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05F_impro02_M041.wav</audio>\\nListen to the tone, pitch, and speed of the speakers voice, and observe whether there are any variations indicating excitement, sadness, anger, or other emotions.

[ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05F_impro03_M067.wav</audio>\\nListen to the tone, pace, and volume of the speakers voice to determine if it conveys happiness, sadness, anger, fear, or neutrality.

The question asks to analyze the tone, pitch, pace, pauses, or fluctuations in a person's voice to determine their emotional state from the four categories: neutral, happy, sad, angry. The ground truth answer is \"happy\". \n\nThe model's response mentions that the recording is of a woman speaking English, saying, \"I'm so happy that you're not going away.\" The key part here is the direct quote: \"I'm so happy...\" which explicitly states the emotion as happy. The instruction was to answer with the four categories, and the model's answer includes the word \"happy\" in the quote. However, the model's response doesn't explicitly state the emotion category as \"happy\" but rather reports the content of the speech. \n\nWait, the user's question says to \"answer with the following four emotion categories\" and to \"state your conclusion.\" The model's response doesn't directly state the emotion as \"happy\" but instead describes the content. However, the quote itself includes the word \"happy,\" which is the ground truth. But the task is to determine the emotion based on the vocal cues, not the words spoken. Wait, the question says to pay attention to tone, pitch, pace, etc., which are vocal characteristics. However, the model's response just quotes the sentence, not analyzing the vocal elements. \n\nWait, the original question might have been accompanied by an audio sample, but in this case, the user provided the model's response as the answer. Wait, looking back, the user provided the model's response as \"The recording is of a woman speaking, in a English, saying, \"I'm so happy that you're not going away.\".\" So the model is describing the content of the speech, not analyzing the vocal characteristics. But the correct answer is \"happy,\" which is the emotion expressed in the content. However, the question says to analyze the tone, pitch, etc., not the content. \n\nBut the user's ground truth answer is \"happy,\" which is the emotion expressed in the content. However, the correct approach would be to analyze the vocal cues, not the words. But in this case, the model's response didn't analyze the vocal cues; instead, it reported the content. However, the ground truth answer is \"happy,\" which matches the content. But the user's instruction was to answer based on the vocal characteristics. So if the model's answer is based on the content rather than the vocal cues, does that align with the ground truth? \n\nWait, maybe the question was presented in a context where the model was given an audio clip, and the ground truth answer is \"happy\" based on the vocal analysis. However, the model's response just quotes the content. But the user's ground truth answer is \"happy,\" which is the emotion expressed in the content. However, the correct method would be to determine the emotion from the vocal cues, not the content. So if the model's answer is based on the content, not the vocal analysis, then it's incorrect. But the user's ground truth answer is \"happy,\" which is the actual emotion. \n\nBut the user's question says to pay attention to the tone, pitch, etc., which are vocal characteristics. So the correct answer should be determined by analyzing those, not the content. However, the model's answer just quotes the content. Therefore, the model's response doesn't align with the ground truth answer because the ground truth is based on vocal cues, but the model's answer is based on the content. Wait, but the ground truth answer is \"happy,\" which is the emotion expressed in the content. So perhaps the user's ground truth answer is correct because the content explicitly states the emotion. But the question says to analyze the vocal cues. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nBut the user provided the ground truth answer as \"happy,\" and the model's response includes the content that says \"I'm so happy...\" which is the same as the ground truth. So even though the model didn't analyze the vocal cues, the answer matches the ground truth. Therefore, the model's response aligns with the ground truth answer.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency.

[ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

But maybe the model is analyzing the first part of the question, which is a statement, not the entire question. \n\nBut the ground truth answer is \"sad\". The model's response doesn't directly state the emotion. It describes the voice characteristics but doesn't conclude with the emotion category. The user's instruction says to answer with the four categories. So the model's response is incomplete because it doesn't specify the emotion. However, the ground truth is \"sad\". If the model's analysis of the voice (low pitch, low volume) is pointing towards sadness, but the model didn't state that, then maybe the answer is not aligned. Wait, the model's response is the analysis, but the user wants the final answer to be the emotion. The model's response doesn't give the emotion. The ground truth is \"sad\", but the model's answer doesn't state that. So the model's response doesn't match the ground truth because it didn't provide the emotion category. Wait, but the user's instruction says to answer with the four categories. The model's response is the analysis, but perhaps the user expects the model to output the emotion. However, in the model's response, they didn't state the emotion. So maybe the model's answer is incomplete. Therefore, the model's response does not align with the ground truth answer. But wait, maybe the model's analysis is leading towards sad. Let me check again. The model says tone is neutral, pitch low, no variation, volume low. If the context is \"Yeah I lost them,\" which might imply sadness. But the model didn't conclude with the emotion. The ground truth answer is \"sad\", but the model's response doesn't state that. Therefore, the model's answer is not aligned. So the answer should be NO.\n</think>\n\nResult: NO", "correct": false}

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nDetermine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_script03_2_M034.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to the tone, pitch, pacing, and volume of the voice, as these aspects often convey underlying emotions that might not be immediately obvious from the spoken words alone.

It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nDetermine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion.

[ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words.

[ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm.

You should follow the examples to answer the last question.Audio 1:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nDetermine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency.

[ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger.

The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_script03_1_M020.wav</audio>\\nListen carefully to the tone, pitch, volume, and speed of the speakers voice, and pay attention to any pauses or changes in these elements; these vocal characteristics can provide clues to the speakers emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words.

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_impro08_M009.wav</audio>\\nPlease notice the tone, pitch, speed, and volume of the speakers voice to help identify their emotion.

The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

[ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation.

[ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words.

The example given is a quote that's clearly aggressive and hostile. The model correctly identifies the emotion as angry. \n\nWait, but the model's response includes the problem statement as part of their answer. The user's question was to answer with the four emotion categories. The model's answer includes the problem statement, but then states the voice sounds angry. The ground truth is angry, so the model's conclusion matches. Even though they included the problem statement, the key part is their assessment of the emotion. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>\n\nResult: YES", "correct": true}

You should follow the examples to answer the last question.Audio 1:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nDetermine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05F_script03_2_F033.wav</audio>\\nCarefully perceive the tone, pitch, volume, and pace of the spoken words, as well as the context and choice of language, to determine the underlying emotion expressed by the speaker.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion.

The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer.

It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger.

The question asks to determine the underlying emotion from the speaker's tone, pitch, pace, volume, and context. The answer needs to be one of the four categories: neutral, happy, sad, or angry.\n\nThe Ground Truth Answer is \"angry\". The Model's Response states that the audio is of a woman speaking in an angry emotion, quoting her saying, \"I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay?\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if the Model's Response correctly identifies the emotion as angry. The quote provided by the model includes phrases like \"I don't care\" and \"okay?\" which can indicate frustration or anger. The context of the statement might suggest irritation, especially if the speaker is dismissing others' behavior. The model directly states the emotion as angry, which matches the ground truth. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any ambiguity. The phrase \"I don't care\" can sometimes be neutral or sarcastic, but combined with the context of the speaker's tone (as mentioned in the question), the model's conclusion of anger seems justified.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nDetermine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice.

[ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05F_impro05_M052.wav</audio>\\nCarefully listen to the tone, pitch, and pace of the speakers voice, as well as the words they use, to determine whether they are expressing emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, or excitement.

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

[ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_script01_1_M011.wav</audio>\\nPay close attention to the tone, pitch, pace, and volume of the speakers voice, as well as the context and choice of words, to determine the underlying emotion they are conveying.

You should follow the examples to answer the last question.Audio 1:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nDetermine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/6.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how the voice rises and falls in pitch and tone, and how the pacing changes to indicate emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nEvaluate the speaker’s emotion by analyzing vocal strength, tone fluctuations, and timing consistency. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nIdentify the emotional state reflected in the speaker’s tone, speech rate, and vocal strength. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression. The speaker is communicating information in a clear and direct manner without any noticeable emotional coloring.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_impro07_F001.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to the tone, pitch, and pace of the speakers voice, as well as any pauses, to infer the underlying emotion.
