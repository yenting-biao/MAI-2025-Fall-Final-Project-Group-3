The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/3.wav</audio>\\nFocus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 4:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05F_script01_3_M025.wav</audio>\\nConsider the tone, pitch, pace, and volume of the speaker’s voice, as well as the choice of words and context of the conversation, to accurately infer the underlying emotion.

The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state. The overall delivery sounds heavy and dejected.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\\n\\n**Sad** Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to how vocal pitch, tone, and articulation change to express different emotions. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nAddress this question progressively, one stage at a time. [ANS] **Stage 1: Analysis of Vocal Characteristics**\\n\\nThe speaker's vocal pitch has a notable rising intonation, creating a melodic and upward contour, especially on the final word. The tone of voice is bright and clear, conveying a sense of energy. The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger. The distinct melodic variation and energetic quality differentiate it from a monotone, neutral expression.\\n\\n**Stage 3: Conclusion**\\n\\nHappy Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 4:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_script02_2_F001.wav</audio>\\nListen closely to the tone, pitch, and pace of the speakers voice, and observe any specific words or phrases that convey emotion, then make an educated guess about the underlying feeling.

The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

The user wants to know if the model's response shows reasoning behavior. The guidelines say to output YES if there's anything beyond a direct answer, and NO if it's just a minimal or factual reply.\n\nLooking at the user input, they provided a specific example where they want the model to analyze a voice for emotions. The model's response is about a question where the speaker says they're scared. The model answers that the person sounds fearful. \n\nNow, the user's instruction was to answer with four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, angry. The model's response here is a direct answer stating \"fearful,\" which isn't one of the listed categories. Wait, but the user's example might be part of a larger context. Wait, the user's input is actually a question that's part of a scenario. Wait, maybe I need to parse this again.\n\nWait, the user input is a set of instructions. They say to pay attention to tone, pitch, pace, etc., to infer emotion from four categories. Then they give an example question: \"I'm just so scared to start over...\" and the model's response is about that example. \n\nSo the model's response is analyzing the example question's speaker's voice and stating they sound fearful. But the user's instruction was to answer with the four categories. The model's answer is \"fearful,\" which isn't one of the four. Wait, but maybe the user's example is a test case. Wait, the user's input might be a test where the model is supposed to answer the example question. Wait, the user input might have two parts: the first part is the instructions, and the second part is an example question. The model's response is answering that example question. \n\nWait, the user input is a bit confusing. Let me recheck. The user input starts with instructions to pay attention to tone, etc., and answer with four emotions. Then they say \"Go through the question logically, then answer it.\" Then the model's response is about the question \"I'm just so scared...\" and says it sounds fearful. \n\nSo the model's answer is a direct response to the example question, stating the emotion as fearful. But the user's instruction was to answer with the four categories. However, the model's answer uses \"fearful,\" which isn't one of the four. Wait, maybe the user's example is a mistake, or maybe the model is supposed to use those categories. But the model's answer isn't using the four categories. So the model's response is a direct answer but not following the categories. \n\nBut the user's original instruction was to answer with the four categories. The model's response here is \"fearful,\" which is not in the list. However, the user's input might have a typo, or maybe the model is allowed to use other terms. Alternatively, perhaps the model's response is a direct answer, but the user's instruction was to answer with those four. So the model's answer is not following the instructions. \n\nBut the task here is to determine if the model's response includes reasoning beyond a direct answer. The model's response is a direct answer: \"Based on the voice, it sounds like this person is fearful in the moment.\" That's a direct answer, not breaking down steps or explaining. So according to the guidelines, if it's a minimal or factual reply, output NO. But the user's instruction might have been to answer with the four categories. Since the model didn't do that, but the user's example might be a different scenario. \n\nWait, maybe the user input is a test case where the model is supposed to answer the example question, and the model's response is a direct answer. The user's original instruction was to answer with four categories. The model's answer is not in those categories. But the task here is to check if the response shows reasoning. The model's response is a direct answer, so it's a minimal reply. Therefore, the answer should be NO. But I need to check if the model's response includes any reasoning. \n\nThe model's response is \"Based on the voice, it sounds like this person is fearful in the moment.\" This is a direct answer without breaking down steps. Therefore, it's a minimal reply. So the answer is NO. But wait, the user's instruction was to answer with the four categories. The model's answer is not in those categories, which might be a mistake.

The user's input says to answer with the four categories, so the model's response should include that. Since it doesn't, maybe the response is not a direct answer but includes analysis.

This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion.

The words are articulated crisply at a moderate pace, without any signs of slowness or aggressive force.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Comparison and Elimination**\\n\\nThis vocal profile can be contrasted with the other emotion categories. The delivery is not low-pitched, slow, or flat, which would be characteristic of sadness. It also lacks the loud volume, tension, or harshness that typically signifies anger.

The model didn't follow that, so maybe it's not a direct answer. \n\nBut the user also said to think in a sequential and structured manner. The model's response breaks down the elements: tone, pitch, pacing, and context. They mention each aspect and how it relates to the emotion. So even though they didn't pick a category, they did analyze the components. So this might be reasoning behavior. The answer isn't just a direct label but an explanation of how the elements contribute to the emotion. So the response includes analysis steps, which is reasoning. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>\n\nResult: YES"}

This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand.

The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase. [ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 4:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05F_script03_2_F021.wav</audio>\\nListen carefully to the speakers tone, pitch, pace, and volume, as well as the context of the words they use, to determine the underlying emotion being conveyed.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nGo through your reasoning gradually, building up to the answer. [ANS] Based on the analysis of the audio, here is an evaluation of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Vocal Strength:** The speaker's voice is very soft and low in volume. It lacks force and energy, sounding subdued and almost breathy.\\n\\n*   **Tone Fluctuations:** The pitch is consistently low and demonstrates very little variation. The tone is flat, with a slight downward inflection at the end of the sentence, which imparts a sense of resignation or weariness.\\n\\n*   **Timing Consistency:** The pace of speech is slow and drawn out. The words are delivered at a deliberate, unhurried, and slightly hesitant tempo.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the weak vocal strength, low and monotonous tone, and slow timing all point to a low-energy, negative emotional state.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps. [ANS] **Step 1: Analysis of Vocal Tone**\\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a moderate pitch with minimal inflection. The pitch does not rise or fall in a way that would suggest strong positive or negative emotions. The delivery is straightforward and matter-of-fact.\\n\\n**Step 2: Analysis of Speech Rate**\\nThe pace of the speech is steady and moderate. The speaker is not talking quickly, which might indicate excitement or anger, nor are they speaking slowly, which could suggest sadness. The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.

[ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence.

The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner. [ANS] Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\\n\\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker begins in a mid-range pitch and noticeably raises it at the end of the phrase, particularly on the word \\\"jacket.\\\" This upward inflection creates a light, lilting quality, which is often associated with friendliness and positive engagement rather than a flat, neutral statement or a descending, sad one.\\n\\n*   **Tone:** The vocal tone is bright and clear. It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion.

[ANS] **Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nIdentify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nSolve the question by progressing through each reasoning stage systematically. [ANS] *   **Tone Analysis**: The speaker's vocal tone is even and uninflected. There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement. There are no vocal cues that point to happiness, sadness, or anger.\\n\\nNeutral Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nDetermine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nReason through the question in a gradual, structured way. [ANS] Based on the audio provided, here is the reasoning for the emotional category:\\n\\n*   **Stress:** The words are spoken with a high degree of force and intensity. There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry Audio 4:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_impro07_F001.wav</audio>\\nPay attention to the tone, pitch, and pace of the speakers voice, as well as any pauses, to infer the underlying emotion.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nDecompose the question into manageable reasoning steps. [ANS] Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe speaker's pitch is low and remains in a narrow, lower range throughout the sentence. There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad Audio 2:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nExamine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion.
