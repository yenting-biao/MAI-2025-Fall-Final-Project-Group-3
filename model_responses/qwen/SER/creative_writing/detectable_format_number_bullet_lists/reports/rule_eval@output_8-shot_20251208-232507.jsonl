[ANS] Based on the audio, here are five concise bullet points describing what the speaker emphasizes most:\\n\\n*   **A specific action:** The importance of not forgetting something.\\n*   **A necessary item:** The speaker singles out a jacket as the essential object.\\n*   **An implied warning:** There's an underlying suggestion about the weather being cool or unpredictable.\\n*   **A direct reminder:** The tone is that of a helpful, clear, and direct piece of advice.\\n*   **The need for preparedness:** The core message is to be prepared before going out. Audio 3:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav</audio>\\nSummarize the key insights from the audio in exactly 4 bullet points. [ANS] Here are the key insights from the audio:\\n\\n*   The speaker is expressing a personal want or making a request.\\n*   The specific item desired is an alarm clock.\\n*   A key condition is that the alarm clock must be \\\"new.\\\"\\n*   The statement communicates a clear and specific consumer need. Audio 4:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/7.wav</audio>\\nDescribe how background sounds contribute to meaning in 2 bullet points. [ANS] Based on the audio clip, here is how the background sounds contribute to the meaning:\\n\\n*   The quiet background and subtle room tone establish an intimate and focused setting. The absence of other sounds (like traffic, music, or other people) directs all attention to the speaker, suggesting they are alone and the moment is one of personal thought.\\n*   The silence amplifies the speaker's contemplative and curious tone. It makes the phrase \\\"I wonder what this is about\\\" feel like an internal monologue spoken aloud, heightening the sense of mystery and introspection for the listener. Audio 5:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/5.wav</audio>\\nList 4 details that reveal the speaker’s personality in bullet points. [ANS] Based on the audio, here are four details that reveal the speaker’s personality:\\n\\n*   **Pensive:** The speaker's slow, deliberate pacing suggests they are thoughtful and considering a possibility rather than making a definite statement.\\n*   **Subdued:** Their quiet volume and monotone delivery indicate a reserved or low-energy disposition.\\n*   **Non-committal:** Using the word \\\"maybe\\\" shows they are uncertain or hesitant to commit to a specific prediction.\\n*   **Calm:** The lack of emotional inflection in their voice suggests a placid and even-keeled temperament. Audio 6:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav</audio>\\nList 3 observations about the speaker’s attitude in bullet points. [ANS] Based on the audio clip, here are three observations about the speaker's attitude:\\n\\n*   **Alarmed and Urgent:** The speaker's loud, high-pitched tone conveys a sense of panic or urgency. They are not simply stating the time; they are exclaiming it as if it's a critical and problematic fact.\\n*   **Exasperated:** There is an undercurrent of frustration, suggesting that the time \\\"11 o'clock\\\" signifies that something is very late or a deadline has been missed, possibly despite a previous warning.\\n*   **Dramatic and Emphatic:** The speaker is intentionally emphasizing the time to maximize its impact on the listener. The delivery is theatrical and meant to convey a strong sense of crisis. Audio 7:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/2.wav</audio>\\nExplain the central conflict or issue in the audio using 2 bullet points. [ANS] Based on the audio, here is the central issue:\\n\\n*   The speaker observes that a surface is slick.\\n*   This condition creates a potential hazard, implying a danger of slipping, falling, or losing grip. Audio 8:<audio>./in-context-examples/audios/general/4.wav</audio>\\nWrite 3 bullet points that capture the progression of ideas in the audio. [ANS] Here is the progression of ideas from the audio in three bullet points:\\n\\n*   The speaker acknowledges that an activity is currently in progress.\\n*   A decision is announced to bring the activity to a halt.\\n*   A specific timeframe is provided, indicating the stop will occur in the immediate future. Audio 9:<audio>./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05F_impro04_F022.wav</audio>\\nSummarize the speaker’s argument in 2 concise bullet points.\"", "response": "The speaker argues that it's really hard to hear.", "follow_instruction_list": [false], "follow_all_instructions": false}
