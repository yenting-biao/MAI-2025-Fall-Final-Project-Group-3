The phrase \\\"Don't forget a jacket\\\" is a common, caring reminder given to someone who is about to go outside. The speaker's gentle and instructive tone suggests a familiar, personal relationship, such as a parent speaking to their child before school or a partner reminding their significant other before they leave for the day.

There is an undercurrent of concern or mild worry in her voice, suggesting she anticipates the subject matter to be serious or unpleasant.
