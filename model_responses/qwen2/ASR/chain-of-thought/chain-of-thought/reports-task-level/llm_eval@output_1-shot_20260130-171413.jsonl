The waveform shows a single, continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. I identify the sequence of sounds as they are spoken:\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"think\\\" (/θɪŋk/)\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"have\\\" (/hæv/)\\n    *   \\\"a\\\" (/ə/)\\n    *   \\\"doctor's\\\" (/ˈdɑktərz/)\\n    *   \\\"appointment\\\" (/əˈpɔɪntmənt/)\\n\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sounds /dɑktərz/ are distinctly recognized as the possessive \\\"doctor's,\\\" not the plural \\\"doctors,\\\" due to the context provided by the next word.\\n    *   The two-syllable word /əˈpɔɪntmənt/ is clearly identified as \\\"appointment.\\\"\\n\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly and Finalization:** The recognized words are assembled into a coherent sentence. A language model evaluates the sequence \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment\\\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment.\\\" <|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nAudio 2: <|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>\\nConvert the provided spoken statement into written words.\\nThink critically about the question before answering.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n\"", "response": "The original content of this audio is: 'He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.

The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required.
