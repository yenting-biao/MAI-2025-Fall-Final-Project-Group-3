In this case, the audio contains the phrase 'rejoice in thy own fresh youth'.\n2.  **Transcription:** The next step is to transcribe the spoken content into written text. This involves capturing the exact words spoken in the audio, including any unique vocabulary or dialects.\n3.  **Punctuation:** After transcribing the spoken content, punctuation needs to be added to ensure the text is easy to read and understand. Proper punctuation includes capitalization, commas, periods, and other symbols that help convey the intended meaning.\n4.  **Word processing:** Finally, the transcribed text undergoes word processing to ensure it is formatted correctly. This may include adjusting the font size, style, and layout to make the text more readable and visually appealing.\n\nBy following these steps, the spoken statement 'rejoice in thy own fresh youth' can be successfully converted into written text.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the actual transcribed speech within the model response as the phrase shown in quotes and removed all explanatory text and meta-comments, leaving only the ASR transcription substring.\n\nResult: rejoice in thy own fresh youth", "correct": 0.0}
