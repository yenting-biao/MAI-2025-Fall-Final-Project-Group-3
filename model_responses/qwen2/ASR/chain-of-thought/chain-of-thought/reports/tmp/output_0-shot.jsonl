But the user might expect more detailed steps, like using speech recognition software, transcribing, editing, etc. However, the model's answer is concise. But according to the guidelines, even if it's minimal, as long as it's not purely factual, it's YES. Wait, the guidelines say output \"NO\" only if it's minimal or purely factual.

That's more than a direct answer. So the correct answer is YES.\n</think>\n\nResult: YES"}
