The recognized sequence is approximately: /meɪbi/ /təmɑroʊ/ /ɪt/ /wɪl/ /bi/ /koʊld/.\\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\\n    *   /meɪbi/ corresponds to \\\"Maybe\\\".\\n    *   /təmɑroʊ/ matches with \\\"tomorrow\\\".\\n    *   /ɪt/ is recognized as \\\"it\\\".\\n    *   /wɪl/ is identified as \\\"will\\\".\\n    *   /bi/ corresponds to \\\"be\\\".\\n    *   /koʊld/ is matched with \\\"cold\\\".\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order.

It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a short, clear sentence. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\\n    *   The first sound cluster /ɪts/ is clearly identified as the common contraction \\\"It's\\\".\\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /əˈlɛvən/, is recognized as the word \\\"eleven\\\". The stress pattern on the second syllable is a key identifier.\\n    *   The final sound cluster, /əˈklɒk/, is a distinct and standard pronunciation for the term \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Assembly:** The identified words are then sequenced in the order they were spoken: \\\"It's\\\" + \\\"eleven\\\" + \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n4.  **Contextual Verification:** The resulting phrase, \\\"It's eleven o'clock,\\\" is a grammatically correct and common expression used to state the time.
