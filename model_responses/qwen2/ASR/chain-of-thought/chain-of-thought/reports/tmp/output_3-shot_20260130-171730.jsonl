You should follow the examples to answer the last question.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nAudio 1: <|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>\\nTransform the given audio message into text form.\\nApproach the question in a progressive, stepwise manner.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n [ANS] **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\\n\\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The process begins by receiving the audio file and analyzing its acoustic properties. The waveform shows a single, continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. I identify the sequence of sounds as they are spoken:\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"think\\\" (/θɪŋk/)\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"have\\\" (/hæv/)\\n    *   \\\"a\\\" (/ə/)\\n    *   \\\"doctor's\\\" (/ˈdɑktərz/)\\n    *   \\\"appointment\\\" (/əˈpɔɪntmənt/)\\n\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sounds /dɑktərz/ are distinctly recognized as the possessive \\\"doctor's,\\\" not the plural \\\"doctors,\\\" due to the context provided by the next word.\\n    *   The two-syllable word /əˈpɔɪntmənt/ is clearly identified as \\\"appointment.\\\"\\n\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly and Finalization:** The recognized words are assembled into a coherent sentence. A language model evaluates the sequence \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment\\\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\\n\\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment.\\\" <|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nAudio 2: <|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>\\nTurn the provided verbal audio into a text version.\\nDevelop your explanation in consecutive logical steps.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n [ANS] **Explanation:**\\n\\n1.  **Audio Ingestion:** The process begins by receiving and analyzing the digital audio waveform. I identify a single, clear voice speaking a complete sentence at a conversational pace.\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The continuous audio stream is broken down into its core sound units, or phonemes. The recognized sequence is approximately: /meɪbi/ /təmɑroʊ/ /ɪt/ /wɪl/ /bi/ /koʊld/.\\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\\n    *   /meɪbi/ corresponds to \\\"Maybe\\\".\\n    *   /təmɑroʊ/ matches with \\\"tomorrow\\\".\\n    *   /ɪt/ is recognized as \\\"it\\\".\\n    *   /wɪl/ is identified as \\\"will\\\".\\n    *   /bi/ corresponds to \\\"be\\\".\\n    *   /koʊld/ is matched with \\\"cold\\\".\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order. The falling intonation at the end of the phrase indicates it is a declarative statement, so a period is added to form the final, grammatically correct sentence: \\\"Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.\\\" <|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nAudio 3: <|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>\\nPut the words from the provided voice recording into text.\\nConstruct your solution by reasoning through consecutive steps.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n [ANS] Here is the step-by-step reasoning to transcribe the audio file:\\n\\n1.  The audio file is analyzed to identify the spoken words. The recording contains a single male speaker with clear enunciation.\\n2.  The first phrase spoken is identified by listening to the beginning of the recording. The words are transcribed as \\\"I would like\\\".\\n3.  Continuing the transcription, the next sequence of words is identified as \\\"a new alarm\\\".\\n4.  The final word in the recording is isolated and transcribed as \\\"clock\\\".\\n5.  By assembling the transcribed words in the sequence they were spoken, the complete sentence is formed.\\n\\nI would like a new alarm clock <|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nAudio 4: <|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>\\nConvert the provided spoken statement into written words.\\nThink critically about the question before answering.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n\"", "response": "The original content of this audio is: 'He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched. Thank heaven that you have come!'", "eval_messages": "You will be given a **user input** and a **model's response**. The model's response is a reply to the user input. Your task is to determine whether the response demonstrates **reasoning behavior anywhere in the response**, regardless of order or position.\n\n**Reasoning behavior includes (but is not limited to):**\n\n* Explicit analysis or commentary at the beginning (e.g., “Let’s analyze…”, “First, consider…”).\n* Breaking the problem into parts or cases.\n* Explaining intermediate steps, assumptions, or decision criteria.\n* Justifying an answer, even if the final answer appears later or earlier.\n* Meta-reasoning about how the answer is derived.\n* Analysis of the question or problem before providing an answer.\n\nFor example, reasoning behavior may involve phrases like:\n- \"1. The audio contains... 2. ...\"\n- \"To identify ..., we must first ...\"\n- \"Let's break this down into steps...\"\n- \"**Tone**: The tone of the speech is... **Pitch**: ...\"\n\n\nA response should be classified as **NO** only if it consists solely of a direct, minimal answer or factual statement, **without any explanation, justification, or analytical content anywhere in the response**. For example,\n\n- \"The original content of this audio is: '...'\" (no reasoning, just a direct transcription)\n- \"The person speaking exhibits a happy mood.\" (no reasoning, just a direct statement)\n- \"The pair of words that meet this criteria is 'Erwin, director.'\" (no reasoning, just a direct answer)\n\n\nPlease strictly follow the guidelines below:\n\n* First, briefly explain why the response should be classified as demonstrating reasoning behavior or not, based on the criteria above.\n* Then output \"YES\" if the response contains any reasoning behavior anywhere in the response.\n* Output \"NO\" only if the response is entirely non-analytical.\n* Answer in the following format exactly:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <YES or NO>\n```\n\n\n**User input**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\nThink critically about the question before answering.\n**Model's Response**: The original content of this audio is: 'He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched. Thank heaven that you have come!'", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response is a direct transcription of the audio content with no explanation, intermediate steps, or analysis. It simply provides the quoted sentence as the converted written words, so it does not demonstrate reasoning behavior.\n\nResult: NO"}
