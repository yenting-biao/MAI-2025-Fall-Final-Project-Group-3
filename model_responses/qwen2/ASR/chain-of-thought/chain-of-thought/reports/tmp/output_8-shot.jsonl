The recognized sequence is approximately: /meɪbi/ /təmɑroʊ/ /ɪt/ /wɪl/ /bi/ /koʊld/.\\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\\n    *   /meɪbi/ corresponds to \\\"Maybe\\\".\\n    *   /təmɑroʊ/ matches with \\\"tomorrow\\\".\\n    *   /ɪt/ is recognized as \\\"it\\\".\\n    *   /wɪl/ is identified as \\\"will\\\".\\n    *   /bi/ corresponds to \\\"be\\\".\\n    *   /koʊld/ is matched with \\\"cold\\\".\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order.

The audio is identified as containing the sequence: /ðə/ (The) - /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ (surface) - /ɪz/ (is) - /slɪk/ (slick).\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each group of phonemes is matched against an extensive vocabulary model to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sound /ðə/ is recognized as the article \\\"The\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /ˈsɜːr.fɪs/ are matched to the noun \\\"surface\\\".\\n    *   The sound /ɪz/ is identified as the verb \\\"is\\\".\\n    *   The sounds /slɪk/ are recognized as the adjective \\\"slick\\\".\\n4.  **Sentence Construction:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken.
