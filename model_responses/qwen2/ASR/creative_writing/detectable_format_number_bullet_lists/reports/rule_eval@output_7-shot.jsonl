Suddenly, they stop and gasp as they realize they had left the proof in three long slips of paper at home.\n\nThe person quickly rushes back to their house, panting heavily, and races up the stairs to their bedroom. They rummage through their drawers, pulling out a small box where they keep important documents. With trembling hands, they open the box and find the three long slips of proof lying at the bottom.\n\nA sense of relief washes over the person as they hold the proof close, realizing they were just in time. The camera zooms in on the person's face, which now displays a mixture of gratitude and fear.

The absence of other sounds (like traffic, music, or other people) directs all attention to the speaker, suggesting they are alone and the moment is one of personal thought.\\n*   The silence amplifies the speaker's contemplative and curious tone.

For example, they might mention that there are ongoing negotiations or that the matter involves sensitive issues.\n*   Consider the audience: Tailoring the message to the audience's interests or needs could make it more persuasive.
