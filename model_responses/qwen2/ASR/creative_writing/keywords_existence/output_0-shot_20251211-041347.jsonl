She had been staring at the same spot for hours, lost in thought. Suddenly, she heard a shuffling noise nearby. Her head turned just in time to see a man stumble out from behind a nearby building, his face twisted in amazed shock.\n\nSarah's heart raced as she watched the man lean dizzily against the tree, his body trembling with fear or exhaustion. She approached him cautiously, trying not to startle him.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked softly, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe man looked up at her, his eyes wide with disbelief. \"I-I can't believe it,\" he stammered, his voice shaking. \"Did you see what I just saw?\"\n\n\"What did you see?\" Sarah repeated, her curiosity piqued.\n\nThe man took a deep breath, clearly still in shock. \"I saw a ghost,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nSarah's eyes widened in surprise. She had always believed in ghosts, but seeing one was something else entirely. \"What did it look like?\" she asked, her voice filled with wonder.\n\nThe man shook his head, his eyes darting around nervously. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"It was just a shadow, moving through the trees. But it felt so real, so... alive.\"\n\nSarah nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. She had seen strange things before, but a ghostly apparition was something she had never encountered before. As she watched the man lean more heavily against the tree, she realized that this moment would stay with her forever. The memory of the amazed man and the ghostly shadow would haunt her for years to come."}
