She had been staring at the same spot for hours, lost in thought. Suddenly, she heard a noise coming from behind her. She turned around to see a man standing there, his eyes wide with amazement.\n\nSarah felt a shiver run down her spine as she took in the man's appearance. He was tall and lean, with broad shoulders and a head full of curly hair that fell just past his shoulders. His clothes were tattered and dirty, and it was clear that he had been traveling for some time.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Sarah asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe man didn't answer at first, but instead leaned heavily against the tree, his gaze fixed on something beyond Sarah's reach. After a moment, he spoke in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"I've been traveling for weeks,\" he said, \"and I finally found what I was looking for.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Sarah asked, feeling a growing sense of unease.\n\n\"The tree,\" the man replied, gesturing towards the oak tree. \"It's been here for centuries, watching over this town. It has seen everything that has happened here, and it knows secrets that no one else does.\"\n\nSarah frowned, not sure what to make of the man's words. But before she could ask another question, the man suddenly collapsed against the tree, his body convulsing in a fit of some kind.\n\nSarah rushed to his side, trying to shake him awake, but he was unconscious. She looked up at the tree, wondering if it had somehow caused this. As she stood there, lost in thought, she realized that she had never felt so amazed by anything in her life."}
