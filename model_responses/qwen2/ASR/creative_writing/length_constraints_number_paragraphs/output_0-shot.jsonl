Your contributions to American engineering have been immense, and your name is synonymous with innovation. Can you tell us about your early life and how you got into engineering?\n\nHarriet Town: Thank you for having me, it's my pleasure to be here. I was born in Philadelphia in 1864 and grew up during a time when America was undergoing rapid industrialization. My father was a carpenter, and from a young age, I was exposed to the world of construction and engineering. As I grew older, I became fascinated by machines and their ability to transform the way we lived our lives. This eventually led me to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nInterviewer: Your work on the development of the first successful motorboat, the Town gasoline engine, is legendary. Can you describe that project and what it meant for America?\n\nHarriet Town: The development of the Town gasoline engine was a turning point in American engineering history. Prior to its invention, most transportation was dependent on horses and steam engines, which were slow, expensive, and polluting. The Town engine, with its high efficiency and low emissions, represented a major step forward in making transportation more accessible and affordable for the average American. It also paved the way for the widespread adoption of automobiles and other modern forms of transportation.\n\nInterviewer: Your contributions to engineering extend beyond transportation. You also made significant advancements in the field of aviation. Can you tell us about your involvement in the development of the first American airplane?\n\nHarriet Town: Yes, I did indeed make contributions to the development of aviation. In the late 19th century, I worked alongside Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright on the design and testing of gliders, which were the precursor to airplanes. When the Wright brothers began working on their powered aircraft in 1907, I was one of the first people they approached for help. I provided technical advice and assistance throughout the development process, and my expertise played a crucial role in the success of their groundbreaking flight on December 17, 1903."}
