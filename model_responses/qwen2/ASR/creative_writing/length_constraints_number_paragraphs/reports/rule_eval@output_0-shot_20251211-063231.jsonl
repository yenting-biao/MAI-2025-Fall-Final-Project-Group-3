I was born into a humble family in England in 1835. My interest in science and engineering began at a young age, and I eventually pursued higher education in those fields. After completing my studies, I moved to America in 1865, where I worked on various projects related to infrastructure development.\n\nInterviewer: Your work on the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge is particularly notable. Can you tell us more about that project and its significance?\n\nSir Harriet Town: The Brooklyn Bridge was a massive undertaking that required innovative solutions to many engineering challenges. As the lead engineer for the project, I had to design a bridge that could span the East River and withstand strong winds and earthquakes. It took four years to complete, but when it opened in 1883, it was considered a marvel of engineering and a symbol of progress in America.\n\nInterviewer: Your contributions to American engineering have been immense. What advice would you give to aspiring engineers today?\n\nSir Harriet Town: To aspiring engineers, I would say to never stop learning and experimenting. Engineering is a field that requires constant innovation and adaptation to changing technologies and environments. Additionally, it's important to have a strong work ethic and a commitment to safety and quality. Finally, remember that engineering is not just about solving problems; it's also about creating something beautiful and useful that can improve people's lives.", "follow_instruction_list": [false], "follow_all_instructions": false}
