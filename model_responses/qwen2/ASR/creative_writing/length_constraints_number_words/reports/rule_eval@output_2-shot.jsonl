Beasts were not easy to come by, but I managed to find some from a local hunting lodge. Birds were a bit easier to acquire, thanks to my connections in the avian community. Fish, however, required a bit more effort as I had to train a fisherman to catch them specifically for the event.\n\nInterviewer: And how did you manage to prepare all these items for the dinner?\n\nMissus Neverbend: It was a meticulous process.
