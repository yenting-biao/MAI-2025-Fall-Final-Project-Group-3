My family has been farming here for generations.\n\nInterviewer: That's great to know. What can you tell us about the farm and its history?\n\nCharacter: Well, our farm is known for producing high-quality apples. We have over 50 varieties of apples planted here, and we're constantly experimenting with new ones to see which ones grow best in our climate. As for the history, my grandfather bought the land from his uncle back in the '40s, and he started planting trees shortly after that. Over the years, the farm has grown and evolved, but the love for apples has remained constant.\n\nInterviewer: That's quite an impressive legacy. How do you manage the farm day-to-day?\n\nCharacter: It's a lot of hard work, but I wouldn't have it any other way. We start each day early in the morning, tending to the animals and making sure everything is ready for the day ahead. In the summer, we're busy picking and processing apples, while in the winter, we focus on maintaining the buildings and preparing for the next season.\n\nInterviewer: It sounds like you take pride in what you do. What motivates you most?\n\nCharacter: Absolutely. For me, it's about providing the best possible produce for our customers.
