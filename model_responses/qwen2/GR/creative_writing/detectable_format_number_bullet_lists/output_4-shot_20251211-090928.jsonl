This is evident from the speaker's slower pace and the use of fillers like 'um' and 'ah', which suggest hesitancy or lack of energy.\n*   **Confession:** As the speech progresses, the tone becomes more candid and reflective. The speaker admits their lack of knowledge and experience, using phrases like 'I don't know' and 'I've never done anything like this before.' This openness indicates a level of honesty and self-reflection.\n*   **Resignation:** Finally, the tone takes on a resigned or helpless quality.
