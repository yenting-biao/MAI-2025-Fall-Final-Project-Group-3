His brooding presence and strange behavior set the villagers on edge, and rumors began to circulate about his dark past. One night, when Sarah was walking home from the market, she heard faint chanting coming from Thompson's house. With her curiosity piqued, she decided to investigate. As she approached the cottage, the chanting grew louder, and she could hear something being dragged across the floor. Suddenly, the door burst open, revealing Mr. Thompson standing there, his eyes glowing with an unnatural light. \"This can avoid the above situation,\" he said, his voice low and menacing. Sarah realized too late that she had stumbled upon something far more sinister than she had ever imagined."}
