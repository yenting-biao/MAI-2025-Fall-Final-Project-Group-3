It feels less like a complete story and more like a prologue to a much larger narrative we're now desperate to hear. It's a compelling, thought-provoking morsel of audio, but it undeniably leaves the listener wanting more.

While the speaker suggests that one year may be better than another, it is subjective and does not take into account personal circumstances or experiences. Some individuals may find one year better than others based on various factors such as personal growth, achievements, challenges faced, or relationships established. Additionally, the statement does not provide any context or information to support the idea that one year is indeed better than another."}
