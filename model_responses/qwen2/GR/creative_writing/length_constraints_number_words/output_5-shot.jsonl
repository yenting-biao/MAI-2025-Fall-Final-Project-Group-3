Benny loved nothing more than hopping around the fields and playing with his friends. One sunny day, while munching on some fresh carrots, Benny spotted something shiny in the distance. Curious, he hopped closer and discovered it was a beautiful, shimmering stone. Excitedly, Benny picked up the stone and showed it to all his friends. They marveled at its beauty and couldn't believe Benny had found such a treasure. From that day on, Benny felt like a true hero, known throughout the field for his incredible discovery. And every time he looked at the stone, he remembered the joy it brought him and his friends."}
