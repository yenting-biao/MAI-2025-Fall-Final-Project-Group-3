Benny loved nothing more than making his friends laugh. He would often pull pranks on them, telling jokes and dancing silly dances. One day, while exploring the forest, Benny stumbled upon a hidden cave filled with treasure. Excited by his discovery, Benny quickly gathered as much treasure as he could carry and returned home. As soon as he showed his friends his bounty, they burst out laughing, amazed by Benny's good fortune. From that day on, Benny became known throughout the forest as the rabbit who brought joy and laughter wherever he went."}
