Benny loved nothing more than hopping around the fields and forests near his cozy burrow. One sunny morning, as he was munching on some fresh clover, he spotted something shiny glinting in the sunlight. Curious, Benny hopped closer and discovered it was a tiny crystal. Excited by his discovery, Benny decided to take the crystal home with him. From that day on, Benny carried the crystal everywhere he went, feeling a special connection to it. He would often sit next to it, talking to it as if it were his best friend. Even though he never knew what the crystal was for, Benny felt a deep sense of joy and companionship knowing he had it by his side."}
