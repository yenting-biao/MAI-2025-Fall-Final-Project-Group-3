Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nWork through this problem gradually, explaining each phase.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nAudio 2: <|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>\\nPay close attention to the tone, pitch, and pace of the voice, as well as any pauses or emphasis, to infer the underlying emotion expressed in the spoken utterance.
