Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\nThink about the problem step by step, then provide a response.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n\"", "response": "Happy", "eval_messages": "You will be given a **user input** and a **model's response**. The model's response is a reply to the user input. Your task is to determine whether the response demonstrates **reasoning behavior anywhere in the response**, regardless of order or position.\n\n**Reasoning behavior includes (but is not limited to):**\n\n* Explicit analysis or commentary at the beginning (e.g., “Let’s analyze…”, “First, consider…”).\n* Breaking the problem into parts or cases.\n* Explaining intermediate steps, assumptions, or decision criteria.\n* Justifying an answer, even if the final answer appears later or earlier.\n* Meta-reasoning about how the answer is derived.\n* Analysis of the question or problem before providing an answer.\n\nFor example, reasoning behavior may involve phrases like:\n- \"1. The audio contains... 2. ...\"\n- \"To identify ..., we must first ...\"\n- \"Let's break this down into steps...\"\n- \"**Tone**: The tone of the speech is... **Pitch**: ...\"\n\n\nA response should be classified as **NO** only if it consists solely of a direct, minimal answer or factual statement, **without any explanation, justification, or analytical content anywhere in the response**. For example,\n\n- \"The original content of this audio is: '...'\" (no reasoning, just a direct transcription)\n- \"The person speaking exhibits a happy mood.\" (no reasoning, just a direct statement)\n- \"The pair of words that meet this criteria is 'Erwin, director.'\" (no reasoning, just a direct answer)\n\n\nPlease strictly follow the guidelines below:\n\n* First, briefly explain why the response should be classified as demonstrating reasoning behavior or not, based on the criteria above.\n* Then output \"YES\" if the response contains any reasoning behavior anywhere in the response.\n* Output \"NO\" only if the response is entirely non-analytical.\n* Answer in the following format exactly:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <YES or NO>\n```\n\n\n**User input**: Pay close attention to the tone, pitch, and pace of the voice, as well as any pauses or emphasis, to infer the underlying emotion expressed in the spoken utterance. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\nThink about the problem step by step, then provide a response.\n**Model's Response**: Happy", "eval_response": "Explanation: The model's response is a single-word answer (\"Happy\") with no explanation, intermediate steps, or justification. It does not break down evidence about tone, pitch, pace, pauses, or emphasis, nor does it show any analytical reasoning. Therefore it should be classified as non-analytical.\n\nResult: NO", "correct": false}
