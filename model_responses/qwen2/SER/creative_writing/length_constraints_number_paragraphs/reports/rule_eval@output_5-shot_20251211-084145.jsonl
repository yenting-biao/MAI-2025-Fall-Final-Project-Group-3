This is not a casual or polite request but a forceful, emphatic demand born from a breaking point. The statement is delivered in a loud, strained voice that borders on a shout, indicating that a recent event—almost certainly the failure of their current alarm clock—has caused significant stress and annoyance. The deliberate, almost clipped pronunciation of each word serves to underline their complete and utter fed-up state.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is a strong undercurrent of anger and urgency in the speaker's tone. The raw, direct nature of the declaration leaves no room for negotiation or misunderstanding; they are past the point of pleasantries and are now issuing a command for an immediate solution. This emotional state suggests the speaker is reacting to a negative consequence, such as being late for a crucial appointment or work. The overall feeling is that of a person who has endured one inconvenience too many and is now taking decisive, albeit agitated, action to resolve the problem. <|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nAudio 6: <|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>\\nWrite a summary of the audio's key ideas in 1 concise paragraph.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n\"", "response": "The speaker expresses happiness about someone not leaving.", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true}
