As the clock ticked closer to midnight, Alex realized that he couldn't let Sarah down by canceling at the last minute. With a heavy heart, he texted Emily, apologizing and explaining the situation. Despite her disappointment, Emily forgave Alex and understood the importance of his friendship. At the party, Sarah noticed Alex's absence and asked around, eventually learning the truth. Although hurt, Sarah appreciated Alex's honesty and the value of their bond. From that night on, the three friends made a pact to always prioritize each other's feelings and commitments over fleeting social events."}
