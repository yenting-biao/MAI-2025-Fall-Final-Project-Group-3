As the clock ticked closer and closer to midnight, Alex realized that he didn't care about missing out on the party. All he wanted was to spend the evening with Emily, and that was worth more than any social gathering. With a heavy heart, Alex texted Sarah to cancel his plans, apologizing profusely but explaining his choice. Sarah, understanding and supportive, wished him a good night and promised to catch up soon.
