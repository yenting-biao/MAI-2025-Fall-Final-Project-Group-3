As days passed, Sarah grew increasingly fond of the fawn, naming it Luna after the full moon that shone bright in the sky over their little camp. However, her peaceful life was soon disrupted when the local hunters learned of Luna and began stalking her. Desperate to protect her beloved friend, Sarah knew she had to act fast. She gathered her courage and set out on a quest to find a way to keep Luna safe from harm. Her journey led her down a path she never could have imagined, but through it all, she discovered a strength within herself she never knew existed. In the end, Sarah's bravery not only saved Luna's life but also inspired others in the town to stand up against the hunters and protect the natural world they all shared."}
