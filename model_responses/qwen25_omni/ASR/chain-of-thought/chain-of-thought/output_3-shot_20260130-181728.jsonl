This forms a grammatically correct and coherent sentence: \"I was bit keeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.\"\n4. **Final Verification:** A final check is performed by re-playing the audio while simultaneously reviewing the constructed sentence. The transcription perfectly matches the spoken words, cadence, and intonation of the audio clip, confirming its accuracy."}
