He was always curious and loved to explore the woods near his house. One day, he heard a strange noise coming from the forest. He was a bit scared but also very interested. He decided to go and find out what it was. As he got closer, he saw a group of animals huddled together. They were all looking at him with fear in their eyes. Tom realized that he had accidentally stepped on a small animal's nest. He quickly apologized and left the forest, feeling a bit guilty but also relieved that he had avoided a situation that could have been much worse. \u2022 Another time, a woman named Sarah was driving home late at night. She was tired and a bit sleepy. As she was about to pass a dark alley, she suddenly saw a figure in the shadows. She was so scared that she swerved the car, almost hitting a parked car. She quickly regained control and drove home, feeling a bit shaken but also glad that she had avoided a potentially dangerous situation. \u2022 And then there was a man named John who was walking his dog in the park. He was talking on his phone when he suddenly tripped over a small rock. He was about to fall, but his dog, a smart and quick dog, caught him and pulled him back up. John was so grateful that he had avoided a fall that could have hurt him. He promised to be more careful in the future.So, what do you think about these stories? Do you have any similar experiences?"}
