Initially, the tone is steady and composed, suggesting a state of normalcy or routine. However, as the speaker starts to speak about the time, there's a noticeable change. The tone becomes more urgent, almost as if the speaker is trying to convey a sense of alarm or a realization of a significant event. This shift implies that the speaker is experiencing a sudden change in circumstances or a realization that something important is happening. The urgency in the tone suggests that the speaker is trying to communicate a sense of immediacy or a need for action, possibly due to the time constraint mentioned. Overall, the shift in tone from calm to urgent highlights the speaker's emotional response to the situation, indicating a sudden realization or a need to act quickly."}
