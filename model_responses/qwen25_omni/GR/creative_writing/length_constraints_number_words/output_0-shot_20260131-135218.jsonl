I didn't have any food on me, but I just laughed and said, \"No, bunny, I don't have any food.\" And it just hopped away, looking a bit disappointed. But it was a really fun moment. So, what do you think about that? Have you ever had a similar experience with animals?"}

There's a sense of confrontation in the way the speaker is asking the question. It's like they're trying to make a point about their relationship with Rachel not being as close as the other person's relationship. There's also a bit of defensiveness in the way they're phrasing it. It's not a very relaxed or friendly atmosphere at all. What do you think about it?"}

It's that instinct that makes you stop and think twice. It's not always logical, but it's often right. So, yeah, I think you were right to have that feeling. What made you feel that way?"}

It can do so many things that we used to think only humans could. For example, it can analyze huge amounts of data in a fraction of the time it would take a human. It can also learn from patterns and make predictions. But, it's not perfect. It can sometimes make mistakes, especially when dealing with complex, nuanced situations. And it doesn't have the same kind of creativity that humans do. But overall, it's a really powerful tool. So, what do you think about AI? Do you have any experiences with it?"}
