The tone sounds a bit harsh, right? The pitch is probably a bit higher than normal, which can indicate frustration. The volume seems to be at a normal level, not too loud or too soft. And the pace is probably a bit faster than usual, as if the speaker is getting a bit impatient. The choice of words like \"insult\" and the overall context suggest that the speaker is not happy at all. So, I'd say the emotion is angry. What do you think?", "eval_response": "Explanation: The model's response concludes the emotion is \"angry\" and provides reasoning (harsh tone, higher pitch, faster pace, words like \"insult\") that matches the ground truth.
