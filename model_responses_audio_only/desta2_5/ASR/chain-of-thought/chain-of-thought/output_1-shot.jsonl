The audio is clear with minimal background noise.\n2.  **Word-by-Word Segmentation:** I then break down the continuous speech into individual, recognizable words. My internal model processes the sounds sequentially:\n    *   The first sound is a clear \"Father\".\n    *   This is followed by the word \"these\".\n    *   Next, the word \"unjust\" is distinctly heard.\n    *   This is followed by the word \"to\".\n    *   The word \"Philip\" is then heard.\n    *   The phrase concludes with the word \"He's\" and then \"going\" and \"into\" and \"business\".\n3.  **Sentence Reconstruction:** The identified words (\"Father\", \"these\", \"unjust\", \"to\", \"Philip\", \"He's\", \"going\", \"into\", \"business\") are then assembled in the order they were spoken. This forms a grammatically correct and coherent sentence.\n4.  **Final Verification:** I perform a final check by re-playing the audio while simultaneously reviewing the constructed sentence: \"Father, these unjust to Philip! He's going into business.\" The transcription perfectly matches the spoken words, cadence, and intonation of the audio clip, confirming its accuracy."}
