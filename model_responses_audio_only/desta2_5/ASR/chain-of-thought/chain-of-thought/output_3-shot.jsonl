The recognized sequence is approximately: /hi/ /k\u028ad/ /h\u0251rdli/ /st\u00e6nd/ /st\u026al/ /so\u028a/ /gre\u026at/ /w\u0259z/ /h\u026az/ /m\u025bnt\u0259l/ /\u00e6d\u0292\u026ate\u026a\u0283\u0259n/ /\u00e6nd/ /hi/ /r\u00e6n/ /t\u0254\u02d0w\u0251\u02d0rds/ /h\u0254\u02d0lmi\u02d0z/ /w\u026a\u00f0/ /tu\u02d0/ /i\u02d0\u0261\u0259r/ /h\u00e6ndz/ /a\u028at/ /stre\u026at\u0283t/ /\u03b8\u00e6\u014b/ /k\u025bv\u025bn/ /ju\u02d0/ /h\u00e6v/ /k\u028cm/.\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\n    *   /hi/ corresponds to \"he\".\n    *   /k\u028ad/ is recognized as \"could\".\n    *   /h\u0251rdli/ matches with \"hardly\".\n    *   /st\u00e6nd/ is identified as \"stand\".\n    *   /st\u026al/ is recognized as \"still\".\n    *   /so\u028a/ corresponds to \"so\".\n    *   /gre\u026at/ is matched with \"great\".\n    *   /w\u0259z/ is identified as \"was\".\n    *   /h\u026az/ is recognized as \"his\".\n    *   /m\u025bnt\u0259l/ corresponds to \"mental\".\n    *   /\u00e6d\u0292\u026ate\u026a\u0283\u0259n/ is matched with \"agitation\".\n    *   /\u00e6nd/ is identified as \"and\".\n    *   /hi/ corresponds to \"he\".\n    *   /r\u00e6n/ is recognized as \"ran\".\n    *   /t\u0254\u02d0w\u0251\u02d0rds/ matches with \"towards\".\n    *   /h\u0254\u02d0lmi\u02d0z/ is identified as \"Holmes\".\n    *   /w\u026a\u00f0/ is recognized as \"with\".\n    *   /tu\u02d0/ corresponds to \"two\".\n    *   /i\u02d0\u0261\u0259r/ is matched with \"eager\".\n    *   /h\u00e6ndz/ is identified as \"hands\".\n    *   /a\u028at/ corresponds to \"outstretched\".\n    *   /stre\u026at\u0283t/ is recognized as \"stretched\".\n    *   /\u03b8\u00e6\u014b/ is matched with \"thank\".\n    *   /k\u025bv\u025bn/ is identified as \"heaven\".\n    *   /ju\u02d0/ corresponds to \"you\".\n    *   /h\u00e6v/ is recognized as \"have\".\n    *   /k\u028cm/ is matched with \"come\".\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order.
