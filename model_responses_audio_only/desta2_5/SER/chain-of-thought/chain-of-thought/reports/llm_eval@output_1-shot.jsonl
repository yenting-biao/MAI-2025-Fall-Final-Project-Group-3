Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\nReview the problem systematically before answering.\n**Model's Response**: Based on the acoustic cues in the audio file, here is a stepwise analysis of the speaker's emotion:\n\n*   **Pitch:** The speaker's pitch is high and rising, particularly on the words \"vile-tempered,\" \"wicked-living,\" and \"evil.\" This rising pitch creates a sense of indignation and anger, as if the speaker is emphasizing the severity of their statement.\n\n*   **Tone:** The tone is sharp and critical, with a slightly strained quality. This tone is characteristic of anger, as it conveys a sense of strong disapproval and displeasure.\n\n*   **Volume:** The volume is high, which further emphasizes the speaker's anger and frustration. The loudness of the speech is likely intended to convey the speaker's strong emotions and to make their point clear.\n\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is fast, with a slightly staccato rhythm. This rapid, clipped pace contributes to the overall sense of urgency and anger, as if the speaker is trying to convey their emotions quickly and forcefully.\n\n*   **Emotional State:** The speaker's high pitch, sharp tone, high volume, and fast pace all strongly indicate a state of anger. The speaker's use of strong, negative language, such as \"vile-tempered,\" \"wicked-living,\" and \"evil,\" further reinforces this interpretation.\n\nAngry", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response includes stepwise analytic commentary about pitch, tone, volume, rhythm, and how those cues lead to the emotional conclusion.
