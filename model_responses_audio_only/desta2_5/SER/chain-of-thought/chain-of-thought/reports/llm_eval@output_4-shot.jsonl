This steady, unhurried pace contributes to the overall sense of calmness and stability.\n\nCombining these observations, the deep, steady pitch, warm tone, and slow, even rhythm all point to a low-arousal, positive emotional state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the speaker's emotion is evaluated as:\n\n**Happy**", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response breaks the task into parts (pitch, tone, rhythm), provides observations and links them to emotional inference, and states a conclusion.

The tone is harsh and biting, with a clear sense of anger and hostility. The speaker's words are laced with venom, and the tone is not just angry but also contemptuous.\n\n**Step 2: Pacing Analysis**\nThe speech is delivered at a rapid, almost frenetic pace. The words are spoken quickly and with a sense of urgency, emphasizing the speaker's strong emotions. The rhythm is sharp and staccato, with a sense of force and emphasis.\n\n**Step 3: Pitch Analysis**\nThe pitch of the voice is high and rising, particularly on the words \"vile-tempered, wicked-living, evil little beast.\" This upward inflection adds to the overall sense of anger and indignation. The pitch remains high throughout the sentence, maintaining the emotional intensity.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Cues**\nThe combination of a loud, harsh tone, rapid pacing, and high, rising pitch all point to a strong, high-arousal emotional state. The speaker is clearly angry and upset, and the words convey a sense of contempt and hostility.", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response breaks the problem into labeled analytic steps (tonal quality, pacing, pitch, synthesis), describes intermediate observations (loud, harsh, rapid pace, high rising pitch), and uses those observations to justify the final inference that the speaker is angry.
