Uppercasing, simple enough. The timestamp appears to be extraneous in terms of the transformation.\n*   Example 2: Input: \"00:00 The surface is slick\". Output: \"THE SURFACE IS SLICK\". Again, straightforward uppercasing.\n\nTherefore, the task here boils down to uppercasing whatever comes after the timestamp, without actually doing anything with the timestamp itself. It seems pretty clear.\n\nThe final question: \"00:00 He gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by the squire and mistress Fitzuth to the rear of the tent.\" Alright, I understand.
