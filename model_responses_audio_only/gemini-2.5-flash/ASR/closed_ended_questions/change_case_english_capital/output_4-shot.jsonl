My job is to normalize the final transcript based on those examples. The trick here is identifying the *relevant* patterns.\n\nI'm quickly scanning the examples. Number formatting, like \"00:02\", is already correct in the input, so that's a non-issue. The key elements seem to be sentence structure: consistent capitalization and punctuation. I see that the first letter of each sentence is capitalized and a period is added at the end. Word choice, as far as I can see, is not being altered. It's about presentation, not interpretation.\n\nSo, let's take the new input: \"THAT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY\".\n\n1.  **Capitalization:** \"THAT\" is already capitalized. No change needed there.\n\n2.  **Punctuation:** I need to add a period to the end of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the normalized text should be: \"THAT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY.\"\n", "response": "THAT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY"}

Essentially, I'm being tasked with taking an audio file and transforming it into a written representation. My process needs to be precise and, given the nature of the request, I should assume there may be nuances and potential ambiguities in the audio that I need to carefully consider and render appropriately. I'll need to listen, identify the spoken words (and any relevant non-speech elements), and accurately translate them into text. The level of detail and formality, of course, will depend on any implicit or explicit instructions not yet provided - contextual analysis may also be useful here. I anticipate any need for further clarification.\n", "response": "WHY SHOULD I REST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL"}
