I'll need to account for any variations in accent, dialect, or speaking style that may be present, ensuring I capture the essence of the speaker's meaning without imposing my own interpretations. Context will be crucial here - while the raw spoken words are the foundation, I'll need to consider the broader intent and any potential nuances embedded within the delivery. If there are any ambiguities, I'll flag them in a note for later clarification.
