The user wants me to transcribe an audio file. My primary directive is clear: capture the speaker's words accurately. I'll need to meticulously listen to the audio. My focus will be on precision and detail. I'll need to parse the nuances of their speech, taking note of any regional accents, speech impediments, or ambiguous phrasing that could potentially introduce errors. I will make a transcript that adheres to the established formatting conventions of the field (assuming there are any indicated preferences) and ensure the accuracy of the final product.\n", "response": "WHY SHOULD I REST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL"}
