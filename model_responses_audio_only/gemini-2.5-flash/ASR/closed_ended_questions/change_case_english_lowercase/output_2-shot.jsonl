This is definitely a continuation task, and in-context learning is key. My initial instinct was to follow the provided capitalization and punctuation rules, but the examples are crucial. I need to be *rigorous* in following the format, so let's break this down.\n\nThe user gives me examples of audio transcripts and their \"cleaned\" versions. Initially, based on the first set of observations, I thought I was supposed to correct capitalization and punctuation. The capitalization analysis seemed straightforward, and punctuation mostly involved sentence-ending periods. However, the examples are the most important piece of data.\n\nWhen I looked more closely at the examples, they *weren't* capitalized or punctuated! This completely changed my perspective. The example outputs showed *lower-cased* and *unpunctuated* text, even though there were obvious grammatical corrections that *could* have been made. My goal isn't necessarily grammar, but to output a very specific version of the given text.\n\nSo, I re-evaluated. My revised conclusion is that the core task is a strict transcription, likely from the audio, as indicated in the examples. My job is to convert the input to a fully lower-cased and unpunctuated version. I should *not* be applying capitalization or punctuation rules. This is like a literal transcription.\n\nSo, for the given input, `Mary Taylor, however, related the tale of Zora to Mrs. Grey's private ear later.`, I'll lower-case everything and remove all punctuation to get: `mary taylor however related the tale of zora to mrs greys private ear later`. That's the correct way to handle this.\n", "response": "mary taylor however related the tale of zora to mrs greys private ear later"}
