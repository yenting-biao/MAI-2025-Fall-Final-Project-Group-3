I've got to analyze the provided examples and apply the transformations to the new sentence. The examples give us a few clues: capitalization, punctuation, and minor contraction fixes are the primary focus.  The input sentence is: \"It is sixteen years since John Burks and died.\"\n\nNow, let's break down those examples. The pattern seems to be: 1) Initial capitalization (or lack thereof), 2) period at the end, and 3) handling contractions (though the examples aren't completely consistent on that initial capitalization \u2013 the first two examples seem to lowercase the *initial* uppercase letter, but the later examples don't).\n\nOkay, so I analyze the input and try to apply what I see in the 5 examples:\n- \"The surface is slick\" becomes \"the surface is slick.\" (Lowercasing)\n- \"maybe tomorrow it will be cold\" becomes \"maybe tomorrow it will be cold.\" (Lowercasing)\n- \"Don't forget a jacket\" becomes \"Don't forget a jacket.\" (No lowercasing)\n- \"It's eleven o'clock\" becomes \"It's eleven o'clock.\" (No lowercasing)\n- \"I would like a new alarm clock\" becomes \"I would like a new alarm clock.\" (No lowercasing)\n\nLet's break that down, in order:\n*   **Capitalization:**  The rule seems to be: capitalize if it's the first word of a sentence (unless it's already lowercase), or is a proper noun (like \"John Burks\"), or \"I\".\n*   **Punctuation:** Always add a period at the end.\n*   **Contractions:** Correct them, but there are no examples to suggest what kind of contractions to fix.\n*   **Grammar/Flow:** I need to make sure I don't introduce grammatical errors.\n\nNow, on to the input sentence: \"It is sixteen years since John Burks and died.\"\n\n*   The first word, \"It,\" is already capitalized, so I'll leave it.\n*   \"John Burks\" are proper nouns, already capitalized, so keep it.\n*   Add a period at the end.\n*   \"John Burks and died\" is awkward, but none of the examples show a correction *that* extensive -- a whole word removed. It's more of a grammatical correction, not a simple capitalization/punctuation task. The instructions are to follow the examples. If it was meant to be grammatically correct, it would be \"John Burks died\".\n\nI am going to keep \"and\" since the examples focus on punctuation and capitalization, and not major grammatical changes like word removal. If the \"and\" was spoken, I need to keep it.\n\nGiven the examples, and focusing on a consistent application of capitalization and punctuation, and assuming this is primarily transcription rather than strict grammatical correction, I get:\n\n\"It is sixteen years since John Burks and died.\"\n", "response": "It is sixteen years since John Burks and died."}
