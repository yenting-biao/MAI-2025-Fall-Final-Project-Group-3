I'll also integrate Natural Language Understanding to clarify the intent. Context and clarity are key here. I'm actively using my NLU capabilities to resolve ambiguities and determine accurate word choices based on the potential meaning of the phrase or utterance.\n*   **Output Generation:** The transcribed text will be generated in an appropriate format. I'll need to consider how the output will be presented and use my language generation capabilities to construct coherent and easy-to-read text. I'll need to make sure this is legible and can be easily accessed.\n*   **Error handling and Quality Control:** I'll automatically apply measures to account for noise and variability in the audio. If there are ambiguities, I will try to resolve them in a sensible way or note the uncertainty.
