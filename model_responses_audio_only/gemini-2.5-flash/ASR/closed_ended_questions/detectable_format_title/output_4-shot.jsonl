My primary objective is to generate the cleaned output, following the examples provided as closely as possible. It's crucial that I rigorously adhere to the input format and stay in \"continuation mode.\"\n\nThe input is an audio timestamp and an ASR transcript. I'm focusing solely on that transcript part, which is \"I want double nine. Hello.\" My goal is to transform this into a properly formatted sentence enclosed within double angle brackets, and it needs to be clean, capitalized, and punctuated.\n\nLet's break this down: First, capitalization. The examples show that the initial word of the output sentence *must* be capitalized. Here, \"I\" is the first word, so it's capitalized. That's simple enough.\n\nNext, punctuation. This is where I need to think carefully, using the examples as my guide. I see a pause in the input transcript after \"double nine,\" so I need to decide how to handle the two phrases \"I want double nine.\" and \"Hello.\" Should they be joined into a single sentence? A comma is a valid option if \"hello\" is treated as an interjection or an afterthought. I'm noticing that the examples always end with a period. My inclination is to keep this simple and concise, as the examples suggest, and since in a conversational context, \u201chello\u201d as a greeting could naturally follow the initial request, so \"I want double nine, hello.\" seems most natural.\n\nTo make my decision, let's look at the given examples:\n\n*   `<<i think i have a doctor's appointment>>` -> \"I think I have a doctor's appointment.\" (Capitalized \"I\", period at the end)\n*   `<<maybe tomorrow it will be cold>>` -> \"Maybe tomorrow it will be cold.\" (Capitalized \"Maybe\", period at the end)\n*   `<<the surface is slick>>` -> \"The surface is slick.\" (Capitalized \"The\", period at the end)\n*   `<<i wonder what this is about>>` -> \"I wonder what this is about.\" (Capitalized \"I\", period at the end)\n\nThe examples are all single, well-formed sentences, ending with a period. There isn't much complexity or need for multiple sentences. The fact that \"hello\" follows the request supports the idea that the two thoughts are joined. If I were to put a period between the phrases, then \"hello.\" would be a separate sentence. Given the trend of the example sentences, it is more natural to combine the phrases into one. So, if I combine the phrases, a comma could join the two phrases. This approach appears consistent with the provided examples.\n\nSo, I will combine the thoughts to make one single sentence using a comma before the word \"hello\" and end it with a period. Capitalization is taken care of with the first letter being capitalized. That gives me: `<<I want double nine, hello.>>` which I then finalize.\n", "response": "<<I want double nine, hello.>>"}

This is in-context learning, so the key is to be meticulous with the given format. \"Continuation mode\" is the goal here. The user has provided examples of raw transcripts and their cleaned counterparts within double angle brackets. My task is to take the final provided raw transcript and generate its cleaned version following the established pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to really analyze the input: \"I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down.\" It's pretty straightforward. There aren't any glaring disfluencies, filler words, or speech errors that need to be removed. Based on the examples, the cleaning seems focused on punctuation and capitalization primarily.\n\nNext, I'll go back to the examples to apply the cleaning rules. It looks like they consistently:\n\n*   Add punctuation (periods) at the end of sentences.\n*   Capitalize the first word of each sentence.\n*   Preserve contractions like \"we'll,\" \"it's,\" and \"I've.\" I also observed that \"I would\" converted to \"I'd\" in one example, but here, \"I get\" is already a standard phrase, so no contraction is needed.\n*   Keep numbers spelled out as words (e.g., \"eleven o'clock,\" \"a couple of minutes\").\n*   Handle hyphenation conservatively. \"Up and down\" is repeated as it is in the original, so no hyphen is required. The examples don't dictate rules for compound adjectives or repeated phrases specifically, but \"up and down\" appears adverbial here.\n\nNow, I'll construct the output step-by-step:\n\n*   Capitalize the first word: \"I...\"\n*   Add the rest of the words as is: \"...get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down.\"\n*   I considered adding a comma before the repeated \"up and down\" to clarify the rhythm. However, looking back at the examples, they're extremely literal. There aren't any commas used for rhythmic separation or complex phrasing. So, I need to stay faithful to the given style.\n*   Add a period at the end: \"I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down.\"\n\nOkay, let's re-evaluate the comma. In spoken language, that comma is often present, but the examples are very literal about punctuation. They don't introduce anything beyond a period at the end. I'm going to stick to the examples for the best outcome. The literal transcription is key.\n\nSo, after a final check, the cleaned version is: \"I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down.\" I capitalize \"I\" and add a period. No other changes are needed. I'm confident that this aligns with the provided examples.\n", "response": "<<i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down>>"}

My understanding is that they expect a verbatim record of what's being said. Therefore, my primary focus will be on careful and accurate listening. I will analyze the audio thoroughly, paying close attention to every word, phrase, and nuance. My objective is to capture the complete and precise spoken content, ensuring the transcription reflects the original audio as faithfully as possible. I'll aim for a transcription that's clean, readable, and true to the source material.\n", "response": "<<Oh, 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, and my great mind most kingly drinks it up.
