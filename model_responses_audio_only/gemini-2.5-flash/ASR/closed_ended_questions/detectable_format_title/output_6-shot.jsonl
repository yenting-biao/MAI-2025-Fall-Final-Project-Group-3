I'll make punctuation decisions based on where the speaker pauses, how they emphasize words, and the overall rhythm of their speech. It's about capturing the *meaning* and the *feel* of the spoken word as accurately as possible, rather than a rote transcription. That means considering things like commas for breaths, question marks for rising tones, and dashes for interruptions or shifts in thought.
