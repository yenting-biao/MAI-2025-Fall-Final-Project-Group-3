The stress and pronunciation match common usage for this name.\n    *   *Self-correction/Refinement for Sentence 1:* Upon re-listening, the phrasing \"these unjust to Philip\" sounds a bit awkward. It's more likely \"These unjust to Philip\" is a fragment or a direct address being cut off. Given the next sentence, it makes more sense that \"Father,\" is an address, and then the speaker is talking *about* Philip. The phrase \"these unjust\" could be a partial thought or a specific context not fully expressed. However, the instruction is to transcribe what is *said*, not to interpret its full meaning if incomplete.\n\n3.  **Sentence 2 - Segmentation and Word Recognition:**\n    *   The next distinct utterance begins with a contraction: \"He's\".\n    *   This is followed by \"going into\".\n    *   The final word is clearly \"business\".\n\n4.  **Punctuation and Formatting:**\n    *   For the first part, \"Father,\" is followed by a comma as it's an address. The rest of the phrase \"these unjust to Philip.\" appears to be a complete, albeit potentially cryptic, thought, so it ends with a period.\n    *   The second sentence, \"He's going into business,\" is a complete declarative sentence and thus ends with a period.\n\n5.  **Final Review:** The transcribed text is read while simultaneously re-playing the audio to ensure precise alignment of words, sounds, and punctuation. The rhythm and intonation match the transcription.\n\n**Final Transcription:**\n\nFather, these unjust to Philip. He's going into business."}

Words like \"just,\" \"smell,\" \"wild,\" \"roses,\" \"always,\" \"spicy,\" and \"rain\" would likely receive high confidence scores due to their clear articulation.\n4.  **Grammar and Contextual Check:** The sequence of words \"Just smell the wild roses.

The overall context also supports the chosen words, ensuring that \"double\" and \"trouble\" are correctly identified in their respective contexts.\n\n4.  **Punctuation and Final Review:** Commas are added where natural pauses or clause separations occur. A period is placed at the end of the complete thought.
