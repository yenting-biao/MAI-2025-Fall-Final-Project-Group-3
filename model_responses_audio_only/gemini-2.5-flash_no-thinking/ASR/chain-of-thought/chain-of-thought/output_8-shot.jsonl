I might cross-reference this with common French surnames or names if uncertainty arose, but the pronunciation is distinct enough.\n\n3.  **Second Phrase - \"besides, can answer your inquiries\":**\n    *   The word after the slight pause is clearly \"besides\".\n    *   Then, \"can answer\".\n    *   Followed by \"your inquiries\". The pronunciation of \"inquiries\" is very clear.\n\n4.  **Assembly and Punctuation:**\n    *   Putting the phrases together: \"Madame Quinson besides can answer your inquiries.\"\n    *   Considering the natural pause after \"besides,\" it functions as an adverbial interjection, often set off by a comma. This improves readability and reflects the spoken cadence.\n    *   The sentence ends with a clear declarative statement, so a period is appropriate.\n\n5.  **Final Review:** I re-listen to the audio with the transcribed text in mind to ensure all words are correctly identified and punctuation reflects the spoken delivery. The transcription accurately matches the audio.\n\n**Transcribed Text:**\nMadame Quinson, besides, can answer your inquiries."}

For clarity and to separate the two distinct parts of the utterance, a period or comma followed by a new word for \"Hello\" is appropriate. Given the context of seeking a specific number (\"double nine\") and then saying \"Hello,\" it sounds like the speaker is giving an instruction or requesting something, then trying to engage someone.

A comma is placed after the initial \"Well, well\" to indicate a slight break. Another comma separates the two distinct parts of the instruction (\"don't trouble to answer\" and \"listen and see...\"). A period concludes the full statement.\n\n5.  **Final Review:** The complete transcribed text is then compared against the audio one final time to ensure accuracy in every word and punctuation choice.\n\n**Final Transcription:**\nWell, well, don't trouble to answer.
