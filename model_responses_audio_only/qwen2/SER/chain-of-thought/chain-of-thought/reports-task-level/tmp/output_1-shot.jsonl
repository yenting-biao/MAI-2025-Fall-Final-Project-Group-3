Model's response is a reply to the question. Your task is to judge if \"model's response\" aligns with the \"ground Truth answer\" based on the \"question\".\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n* Judge alignment based on semantic correctness, not surface-level wording.\n* Minor paraphrasing or differences in expression are acceptable if the meaning is equivalent.\n* If the model's response misses essential information, or contradicts the ground truth answer, it should be considered non-aligned.\n\nPlease strictly follow the guidelines below:\n* First, provide a brief explanation why the response aligns or does not align with the ground truth answer, based on the criteria above.\n* Then Output \"YES\" if the response aligns with the ground truth answer; output \"NO\" if the response does not match the ground truth answer.\n* Answer in the following format exactly:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <YES or NO>\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Pay close attention to the tone, pitch, and pace of the voice, as well as any pauses or emphasis, to infer the underlying emotion expressed in the spoken utterance. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\nThink about the problem step by step, then provide a response.\n**Ground Truth Answer**: happy\n**Model's Response**: Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the vocal characteristics in the audio file:\n\n**Step 1: Pitch Analysis**\nThe speaker's pitch is high and rises sharply from a low starting point. This indicates a positive emotion such as surprise or excitement.\n\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\nThe tone of the voice is light and energetic, with a noticeable vibrancy and a sense of elation.
