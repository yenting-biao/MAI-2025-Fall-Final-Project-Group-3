This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion.

This jagged rhythm reflects the speaker's angry and frustrated emotional state.\n\n*   **Pauses and emphasis:** The speaker makes frequent pauses and emphasizes certain words, particularly the word \"you.\" This emphasis suggests a focus on the speaker's anger and frustration towards the listener.\n\nBased on these observations, the low pitch, harsh tone, fast pace, and frequent emphasis all strongly indicate a negative emotional state.\n\nAngry"}

Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion.

The speaker is expressing admiration or enthusiasm for something, rather than frustration or anger.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\\n\\nSpeech: [AUDIO 1]<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n**Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>user\\nPay attention to the tone, pitch, and pace of the speakers voice, as well as any pauses, to infer the underlying emotion.

There is a noticeable lilt in the pitch, which contributes to the overall positive and cheerful mood. The tone is light and airy, with no hint of tension or aggression.\n\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\nThe speech is delivered at a moderate pace, with a slight upward inflection at the end of each sentence. This rising intonation is a common feature of happy speech, as it conveys a sense of excitement and enthusiasm.\n\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\nThe pitch of the voice is relatively high, but not as high as the previous example. The overall pitch range is moderate, with no sustained high pitch or low pitch. This balanced pitch contributes to the overall positive and cheerful mood.\n\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\nThe words themselves (\"for real\") could form a neutral statement, but the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a warm, upbeat tone, gentle pitch, and moderate pacing, as well as the absence of pauses, indicates a positive and happy emotion.
