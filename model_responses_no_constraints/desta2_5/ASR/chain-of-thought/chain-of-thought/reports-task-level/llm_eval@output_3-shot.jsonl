The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio is first analyzed to identify key acoustic features. It contains a single human voice, which sounds high-pitched, speaking a lengthy, complex sentence. There is minimal background noise, which aids in accurate recognition.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Word Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonetic sounds.\n    *   The first sound cluster /ʌnˈfɔrtʃuəntli/ is clearly identified as the word \"unfortunately\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /ðə ˈfræktʃər/ is recognized as the word \"fracture\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /kʊd ˈnɒt ˈbɪ ˈsɛt/ is identified as the phrase \"could not be set\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /tɪl ˈsɪks/ is recognized as the word \"till six\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /oʊk/ is identified as the word \"o'clock\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /ðə ˈnɛkst/ is recognized as the word \"next\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /mɔrnɪŋ/ is identified as the word \"morning\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /əz/ is recognized as the word \"as\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /nɒ ˈsɜːrʒən/ is identified as the word \"no surgeon\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /wəz/ is recognized as the word \"was\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /tə ˈbɪ ˈbɪfɔr/ is identified as the phrase \"to be before\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /ðæt/ is recognized as the word \"that\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /tɪm/ is identified as the word \"time\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /ənd/ is recognized as the word \"and\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /ʃiː/ is identified as the word \"she\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /nɔʊ/ is recognized as the word \"now\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /laɪz/ is identified as the word \"lies\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /ɑt/ is recognized as the word \"at\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /ɔʊr/ is identified as the word \"our\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /haʊs/ is recognized as the word \"house\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /ɪn/ is identified as the word \"in\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /ə/ is recognized as the word \"a\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /vəri/ is identified as the word \"very\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /daʊnbtəʊl/ is recognized as the word \"doubtful\".\n    *   The following sound cluster, /ənd/ is identified as the word \"and\".\n    *   The next sequence of sounds, /dæŋʒərəs/ is recognized as the word \"dangerous\".\n\n3.  **Sentence Assembly and Finalization:** The identified words are assembled into a coherent sentence. A language model evaluates the sequence \"Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the final transcribed sentence provided by the model and removed all preceding analysis and meta-comments, keeping only the continuous substring that is the transcription.\n\nResult: \"Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.\"", "correct": 0.02631578947368421}
