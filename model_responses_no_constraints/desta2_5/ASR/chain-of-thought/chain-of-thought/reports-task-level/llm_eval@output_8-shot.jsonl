The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken phrases into written words.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio is received and analyzed to identify the speaker, tone, and content.

The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Audio Analysis:** The audio is first analyzed to identify its key characteristics.

The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided speech into written text.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Audio Analysis:** The audio is first analyzed to identify its key characteristics. It contains a single, clear voice speaking a short, complex sentence. The speaker's tone is calm, and the speech is delivered at a moderate pace.\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its smallest units of sound, or phonemes.\n    *   The sequence /wɛl/ is identified as the interjection \"Well\".\n    *   The next sound cluster /wɛl/ is also recognized as \"well\".\n    *   The sound /dɒn/ is matched to the word \"don't\".\n    *   The sequence /trʌbl/ is identified as the verb \"trouble\".\n    *   The sound /tə/ is recognized as the indefinite article \"to\".\n    *   The sound /answər/ is matched to the verb \"answer\".\n    *   The sequence /lɪsən/ is identified as the verb \"listen\".\n    *   The sound /ənd/ is recognized as the conjunction \"and\".\n    *   The sequence /si/ is identified as the conjunction \"see\".\n    *   The sound /ðæt/ is matched to the pronoun \"that\".\n    *   The sound /aɪ/ is recognized as the first-person singular pronoun \"I\".\n    *   The sequence /də/ is identified as the indefinite article \"do\".\n    *   The sound /juː/ is matched to the pronoun \"you\".\n    *   The sound /nə/ is recognized as the indefinite article \"no\".\n    *   The sequence /ɪn/ is identified as the negative adverb \"in\".\n    *   The sound /jʊstɪs/ is matched to the adjective \"injustice\".\n3.  **Sentence Construction:** The identified words are assembled in the order they were spoken: \"Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.\"\n4.  **Final Verification:** The resulting sentence is checked for grammatical correctness and contextual coherence. The sentence is a complex, formal expression, which is consistent with the speaker's tone and language usage, confirming the accuracy of the transcription.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the final assembled sentence in the model's response that represents the transcription and removed all explanatory and analytical text.
