For example,\n\n- \"The original content of this audio is: '...'\" (no reasoning, just a direct transcription)\n- \"The person speaking exhibits a happy mood.\" (no reasoning, just a direct statement)\n- \"The pair of words that meet this criteria is 'Erwin, director.'\" (no reasoning, just a direct answer)\n\n\nPlease strictly follow the guidelines below:\n\n* First, briefly explain why the response should be classified as demonstrating reasoning behavior or not, based on the criteria above.\n* Then output \"YES\" if the response contains any reasoning behavior anywhere in the response.\n* Output \"NO\" only if the response is entirely non-analytical.\n* Answer in the following format exactly:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <YES or NO>\n```\n\n\n**User input**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\n**Model's Response**: **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Audio Analysis:** The process begins by receiving the audio file and analyzing its acoustic properties.

A language model evaluates the sequence \"But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response includes step-by-step analysis (audio analysis, phonetic segmentation, word recognition, syntactic assembly) and explains intermediate steps and justifications for the final transcription, which qualifies as reasoning behavior.\n\nResult: YES", "correct": true}

The audio contains... 2. ...\"\n- \"To identify ..., we must first ...\"\n- \"Let's break this down into steps...\"\n- \"**Tone**: The tone of the speech is... **Pitch**: ...\"\n\n\nA response should be classified as **NO** only if it consists solely of a direct, minimal answer or factual statement, **without any explanation, justification, or analytical content anywhere in the response**.

The audio contains... 2. ...\"\n- \"To identify ..., we must first ...\"\n- \"Let's break this down into steps...\"\n- \"**Tone**: The tone of the speech is... **Pitch**: ...\"\n\n\nA response should be classified as **NO** only if it consists solely of a direct, minimal answer or factual statement, **without any explanation, justification, or analytical content anywhere in the response**.
