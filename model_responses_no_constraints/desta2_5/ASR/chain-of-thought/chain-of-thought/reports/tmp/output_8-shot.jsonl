Since the passage is a poetic expression, it is not a standard sentence, but a poetic statement.\n\n4.  **Final Review:** The complete transcribed passage is compared against the audio one last time to ensure accuracy in wording and context.\n\nBased on this process, the spoken content is transcribed as:\n\nI couldn't shiver much being bound so tight, but when I'm loose, I mean to have just one good shiver to relieve my feelings.", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response includes a multi-step \"Step-by-Step Breakdown\" explaining how the transcription was derived (initial audio analysis, phonetic segmentation, sentence construction, final review) and details intermediate identifications and assembly of words—this is explicit reasoning about the process.\n\nResult: YES"}
