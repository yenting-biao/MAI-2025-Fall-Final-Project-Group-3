The tone is flat and lacks the emotional intensity of angry speech.\n\n**Phase 2: Pitch Analysis**\nThe pitch of the voice is low and remains relatively steady throughout the short sentence. There is no significant rise or fall in pitch, which is often indicative of emotional expression. The flat pitch contributes to the overall sense of emotional flatness.\n\n**Phase 3: Pacing Analysis**\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are enunciated clearly, but there is no sense of urgency or emphasis, which is often present in angry or happy speech. The slow pace contributes to the overall sense of sadness.\n\n**Phase 4: Contextual Analysis**\nThe speaker says \"I lost them,\" which is a statement that typically conveys a sense of loss or disappointment. The context of the conversation is not provided, but the words themselves suggest a negative emotional state.\n\n**Phase 5: Synthesis of Cues**\nConsidering the flat tone, low pitch, slow pace, and the context of the statement, the overall emotional state of the speaker is clearly negative. The lack of emotional intensity, the flat tone, and the slow pace all point to a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\n\nSad", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response contains stepwise analysis (phases for tone, pitch, pacing, context, and synthesis) and explains how each cue leads to the inference of \"sad\".

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion.

There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion.
