There is no warmth, enthusiasm, or excitement, which are typically associated with happiness. The tone is not strained or heavy, which could suggest sadness or anger.\n\n*   **Pitch:** The pitch is moderate and stable, with no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong emotions. The speaker's voice is not rising or falling in a way that would suggest excitement, sadness, or frustration.\n\n*   **Pace:** The speech is delivered at a normal, conversational pace. The words are not rushed, which might indicate anxiety or anger, nor are they slow, which could suggest sadness. The rhythm is steady and even.\n\n*   **Volume:** The speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no loudness or softness that would be associated with strong emotions.\n\n*   **Context:** The speaker explicitly states that they are not bragging, which suggests a desire to clarify their intentions and avoid being perceived as boastful. This self-awareness and attempt to manage the listener's perception indicate a neutral emotional state.\n\nThe combination of a matter-of-fact tone, stable pitch, normal pace, and normal volume, along with the context of the speaker's words, all point to a neutral emotional state.\n\nNeutral", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response includes explicit analysis of multiple features (tone, pitch, pace, volume, context) and explains how each leads to the emotional inference.

Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\n**Model's Response**: **Step 1: Tone Analysis**\nThe speaker's tone is characterized by a high level of emotional intensity. The voice is raised, and the words are spoken with a sense of urgency and frustration. The tone is not flat or monotone, which would be typical of a neutral or happy state.\n\n**Step 2: Pitch Analysis**\nThe pitch of the voice is high and rising, with a questioning intonation. The speaker is asking rhetorical questions, which suggests a sense of exasperation and disbelief. The pitch does not fall or drop, which would be more characteristic of sadness or resignation.\n\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\nThe pace of speech is rapid and urgent. The words are delivered quickly, with a sense of impatience and frustration. The rhythm is not slow or drawn out, which would be more typical of sadness or a neutral state.\n\n**Step 4: Volume Analysis**\nThe volume of the voice is high, with a sense of emphasis on certain words. The speaker is not speaking softly or quietly, which would be more characteristic of sadness or a neutral state.\n\n**Step 5: Context and Word Choice Analysis**\nThe speaker is questioning the idea of giving up hope, which suggests a sense of desperation and frustration. The use of words like \"contradict\" and \"straight out\" implies a sense of conflict and disagreement.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesis of Observations**\nThe combination of a high and rising tone, rapid pace, high volume, and urgent context all point to a high-arousal, negative emotional state.\n\nAngry", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response breaks the analysis into labeled steps (tone, pitch, pacing, volume, context, synthesis), explains observations and links them to emotional interpretations, and justifies the final label based on those intermediate analyses.

There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion. Please answer with the following four emotion categories: neutral, happy, sad, and angry.\", \"audios\": [{\"audio\": \"./in-context-examples/audios/general/0.wav\", \"text\": null}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"**Phase 1: Tonal Quality Analysis**\\nThe speaker's voice is loud and has a strained, forceful quality. There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Determine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice.

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Focus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words.

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<|AUDIO|>Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation.

There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation. The delivery is straightforward, similar to someone making a simple observation or stating a possibility.\\n\\n*   **Pitch Modulation Analysis**: The pitch of the voice remains relatively stable throughout the sentence. There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.
