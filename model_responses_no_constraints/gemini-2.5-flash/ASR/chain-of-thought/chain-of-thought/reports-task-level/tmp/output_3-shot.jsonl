No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided audio statement into written text.\n**Model's Response**: <thinking_summary>\nOkay, here's my interpretation of this process, broken down as you requested:\n\n**My Transcription Workflow**\n\nAlright, I'm going to outline my mental approach to transcribing this audio. I'll structure it like I have in the past, breaking it down into a logical series of steps, much like I would analyze any complex process. I'll think about the audio as it comes in and then dissect it step by step.\n\n1.  **Audio Reception:** First, the audio file itself needs to be available. That's the baseline, the raw input that everything else hinges on.\n2.  **Sound Deconstruction:** Next comes the phonetic segmentation. I'll need to break down the incoming sounds into their fundamental phonemic components. This is the foundation of understanding spoken language.\n3.  **Lexical Identification:** Now, based on the phonemes I just derived, the next step is to perform word recognition. It's time to map those phonemes onto the lexicon and identify the individual words.\n4.  **Syntactic Construction:** Once I have the words identified, I need to put the pieces together. I have to combine them, assemble the words, and make sense of them by constructing sentences and creating a coherent whole.\n5.  **Refinement:** Finally, I'll attend to the nuances. I'll need to add punctuation, consider capitalization, and add the fine-tuning that makes the transcription human-readable and meaningful, the polishing touches.\n\n</thinking_summary>\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initial Audio Analysis:** The audio stream is first processed to identify speech segments and characteristics like pitch, volume, and rhythm. The speaker's voice is clear, and the pace is moderate, with no significant background noise to impede recognition.\n\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation and Allophone Identification:** The speech is broken down into its constituent phonemes and their allophonic variations. For example:\n    *   /wɪl/ for \"Will\"\n    *   /kraɪd/ for \"cried\"\n    *   /hiː/ for \"he\"\n    *   /ˈsɒftli/ for \"softly\"\n    *   /ænd/ for \"and\"\n    *   /ˈstʌtli/ for \"Stutely\" (a proper noun, recognized from context and common proper noun patterns)\n    *   /huː/ for \"who\"\n    *   /hæd/ for \"had\"\n    *   /ˈtʃoʊzn/ for \"chosen\"\n    *   /hɪz/ for \"his\"\n    *   /kaʊtʃ/ for \"couch\"\n    *   /əˈkrɒs/ for \"across\"\n    *   /ðə/ for \"the\"\n    *   /dɔːr/ for \"door\"\n    *   /ɒv/ for \"of\"\n    *   /hɪz/ for \"his\"\n    *   /jʌŋ/ for \"young\"\n    *   /ˈmæstərz/ for \"master's\" (possessive 's' detected)\n    *   /ˈtʃeɪmbər/ for \"chamber\"\n    *   /spræŋ/ for \"sprang\"\n    *   /ʌp/ for \"up\"\n    *   /ət/ for \"at\"\n    *   /wʌns/ for \"once\"\n    *   /ænd/ for \"and\"\n    *   /ˈænsər/ for \"answer\"\n\n3.  **Word Recognition and Lexical Matching:** Each phonetic sequence is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary and statistical language model to identify the most probable words. The model successfully distinguishes between similar-sounding words based on context (e.g., \"had\" vs. \"hat\"). The proper noun \"Stutely\" is recognized as a named entity.\n\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly and Grammatical Analysis:** The recognized words are then assembled into a coherent sentence structure. The language model evaluates the sequence for grammatical correctness and semantic plausibility within the English language. This step helps confirm word choices and identify sentence boundaries.\n\n5.  **Punctuation and Formatting:** Finally, appropriate punctuation is added, including capitalization for the start of the sentence and the proper noun, and a comma and period to reflect the phrasing and end of the statement.\n\nThe final transcribed text is: \"Will, cried he softly, and Stutely, who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber, sprang up at once in answer.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the explicit final transcribed sentence at the end of the model response and removed all preceding commentary, reasoning, and phonetic detail, leaving only the ASR output sentence verbatim.\n\nResult: \"Will, cried he softly, and Stutely, who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber, sprang up at once in answer.\""}

The stress pattern on the second syllable is a key identifier.\\n    *   The final sound cluster, /əˈklɒk/, is a distinct and standard pronunciation for the term \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n3.  **Sentence Assembly:** The identified words are then sequenced in the order they were spoken: \\\"It's\\\" + \\\"eleven\\\" + \\\"o'clock\\\".\\n4.  **Contextual Verification:** The resulting phrase, \\\"It's eleven o'clock,\\\" is a grammatically correct and common expression used to state the time.

The user is asking me to transcribe audio. This isn't just about capturing words; it's about providing a *complete* and accurate textual representation of the spoken content. Therefore, my priority is meticulous listening. I'll need to pay close attention not just to the words themselves, but also to the nuances of delivery – pauses, intonation cues, and of course, the appropriate punctuation to reflect sentence structure and meaning. It's about translating the *spoken* into the *written* with fidelity, ensuring clarity and readability in the final text. I need to get it right.\n\n</thinking_summary>\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Initial Playback:** The audio is played through to get a general understanding of the content, the speaker's voice (male, clear, somewhat deliberate), and the pacing.\n2.  **Word-by-Word Analysis:** The audio is replayed in sections to pinpoint individual words.\n    *   \"And the whole night\" is clearly enunciated.\n    *   \"the trees stood still\" follows distinctly.\n    *   \"and in deep thought\" concludes the sentence.\n3.  **Punctuation and Capitalization:**\n    *   The sentence starts with \"And\", which often connects to a previous thought but here functions as the start of the provided audio segment.\n    *   There's a natural pause or slight emphasis before \"the trees\", suggesting a comma isn't strictly necessary if it's a continuous thought, but the phrasing makes it flow as one complete idea.\n    *   The falling intonation at the end of \"thought\" indicates a period.\n\nThe transcribed text is:\n\nAnd the whole night, the trees stood still and in deep thought.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the transcription block at the end of the response (\"The transcribed text is:\" followed by the sentence) and removed all surrounding meta-comments and reasoning, leaving only the exact transcribed sentence.\n\nResult: And the whole night, the trees stood still and in deep thought."}

My approach will be a deep dive. I'm going to meticulously listen to the audio, almost dissecting it phonetically. It's not just about capturing sounds, but *identifying* them. I'll need to use my expertise to parse unclear segments, account for regional accents, and differentiate similar-sounding words in context. The goal is pinpoint accuracy at the word level. Once I've got a solid, validated understanding of each word, I'll systematically assemble them into a cohesive and accurate written document. The final product needs to be a faithful representation of the spoken content, free of misinterpretations.\n\n</thinking_summary>\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the transcription:\n\n1.  **Initial Listen:** The audio is played to get a general understanding of the content. A clear male voice is heard, speaking in an excited tone.\n2.  **Word-by-Word Identification:**\n    *   The first sound clearly forms \"There's a\".\n    *   This is immediately followed by \"whale\".\n    *   A slight pause, then \"a whale\" is repeated with more emphasis.\n    *   The next distinct phrase is \"cried the\".\n    *   The final word is clearly \"professor\".\n3.  **Sentence Construction and Punctuation:** The identified words are put together in order. Given the excited tone and the word \"cried\", it's appropriate to punctuate it as direct speech.\n\n**Transcription:**\n\"There's a whale, a whale,\" cried the professor.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the ASR transcription as the final quoted line the model provided under \"Transcription\" and removed all preceding explanatory and meta-content; I copied that sentence verbatim as it appears in the response.\n\nResult: \"There's a whale, a whale,\" cried the professor."}

And she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the explicit \"Transcribed Text\" block in the model's response and removed all preceding explanatory and meta-content. I copied the transcription exactly as a continuous substring without altering punctuation, capitalization, or wording.\n\nResult: Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning, as no surgeon was to be had before that time. And she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state."}

The waveform shows a single, continuous utterance from one speaker in a low-noise environment.\\n\\n2.  **Phonetic Segmentation:** The speech is broken down into its fundamental sound units, or phonemes. I identify the sequence of sounds as they are spoken:\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"think\\\" (/θɪŋk/)\\n    *   \\\"I\\\" (/aɪ/)\\n    *   \\\"have\\\" (/hæv/)\\n    *   \\\"a\\\" (/ə/)\\n    *   \\\"doctor's\\\" (/ˈdɑktərz/)\\n    *   \\\"appointment\\\" (/əˈpɔɪntmənt/)\\n\\n3.  **Word Recognition:** Each phonetic cluster is matched against a vast linguistic dictionary to identify the most probable words.\\n    *   The sounds /dɑktərz/ are distinctly recognized as the possessive \\\"doctor's,\\\" not the plural \\\"doctors,\\\" due to the context provided by the next word.\\n    *   The two-syllable word /əˈpɔɪntmənt/ is clearly identified as \\\"appointment.\\\"\\n\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly and Finalization:** The recognized words are assembled into a coherent sentence. A language model evaluates the sequence \\\"I think I have a doctor's appointment\\\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English.

The recognized sequence is approximately: /meɪbi/ /təmɑroʊ/ /ɪt/ /wɪl/ /bi/ /koʊld/.\\n3.  **Lexical Matching:** Each group of phonemes is matched against a vast vocabulary to identify the most likely words.\\n    *   /meɪbi/ corresponds to \\\"Maybe\\\".\\n    *   /təmɑroʊ/ matches with \\\"tomorrow\\\".\\n    *   /ɪt/ is recognized as \\\"it\\\".\\n    *   /wɪl/ is identified as \\\"will\\\".\\n    *   /bi/ corresponds to \\\"be\\\".\\n    *   /koʊld/ is matched with \\\"cold\\\".\\n4.  **Syntactic Assembly:** The identified words are arranged in sequential order.
