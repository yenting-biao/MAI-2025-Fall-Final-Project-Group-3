My primary focus is accuracy; I need to make sure I'm capturing the precise words spoken. As a transcriptionist, I know there are different aspects to consider with any recording. First, I need to listen carefully to the audio, really focusing on the nuances of the speaker's tone, pacing, and any potentially unclear pronunciation. I'll need to identify any background noises and determine if they're relevant, or whether I can filter them out without affecting the core message. I will decide on the proper formatting based on the requirements the user wants. The goal is to provide a clean, readable text version that accurately reflects the original audio, without the need for the user to make extensive edits. This all depends on the quality of the recording.\n", "response": "Why should I rust and be stupid and sit in an action because I am a girl?"}
