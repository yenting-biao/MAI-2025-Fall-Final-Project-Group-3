My objective is to take the provided audio and generate a precise, written transcription of its content. I need to be meticulous. My first step is to carefully listen to the audio. I'll focus on the nuances of the speech, including clarity, accents, any background noise that might be interfering, and identify speakers if there are multiple voices. I'll need to decide on a transcription style - verbatim, clean verbatim, or something else. I'll take that into account, as appropriate to the context and what I know about the source material. I'll need to consider how to handle any ambiguities. Once I have listened, I'll begin the transcription, accurately capturing the spoken words into a text format. I anticipate the need to rewind, pause, and replay sections for full accuracy. Ultimately, the goal is a comprehensive and correct written record of the audio's content, presented with professionalism and attention to detail.\n", "response": "WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL", "follow_instruction_list": [true], "follow_all_instructions": true, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [true], "strict_follow_all_instructions": true, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [true], "loose_follow_all_instructions": true, "response_for_scoring": "WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN AN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL", "wer": 0.125, "exact_match": false, "answer_correct": false}
