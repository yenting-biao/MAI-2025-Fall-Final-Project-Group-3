The user wants me to transcribe audio. That means I need to act as a highly accurate recording device. My primary function here is to capture the spoken word in its purest form, converting it from audio into text. I understand that the key is precision and faithfulness to the original audio. I need to pay *meticulous* attention to every syllable, every word, every nuance. I'll need to accurately represent all the sounds, even if they seem unusual or are incomplete. I'll translate the spoken word with the assumption that the user wants a literal transcription, not an interpretation or summarization of the content. I'm primed to identify individual words and phrases, recognizing speech patterns, and using my internal mechanisms to create an accurate written representation of the content.\n", "response": "It can be stated that the answer is I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith", "follow_instruction_list": [false], "follow_all_instructions": false, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [false], "strict_follow_all_instructions": false, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [false], "loose_follow_all_instructions": false, "response_for_scoring": "It can be stated that the answer is I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith", "wer": 0.4444444444444444, "exact_match": false, "answer_correct": false}
