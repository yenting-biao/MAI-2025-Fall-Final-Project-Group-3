My process will be as follows: I need to take the provided audio and convert it to a written document with no loss of content. I will pay close attention to the speaker's words, identifying and representing them in the new format. I will need to be careful with any ambiguous pronunciations and make sure not to create any unintended alterations. I will need to be sure that I am understanding the meaning of the content, if necessary, to ensure the correctness of my response. I have no specific formatting requirements beyond accuracy, but I will need to be mindful of speaker changes, and any potentially important non-verbal cues (pauses, emphasis, etc.) that might add meaning and aid understanding.
