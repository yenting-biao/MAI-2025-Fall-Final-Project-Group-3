My internal processes are immediately engaged. I'll meticulously listen to the audio stream, resolving any ambiguities in pronunciation or enunciation as they arise. I'll focus on individual phonemes, word boundaries, and overall cadence, cross-referencing against my internal lexicon and grammatical models to ensure accuracy. Any potential homophones or variations in accent will require special attention. My goal is a flawless rendition of the spoken words into written form. I'm ready to begin the transcription.\n", "response": "Since when has malady banished medicine?"}
