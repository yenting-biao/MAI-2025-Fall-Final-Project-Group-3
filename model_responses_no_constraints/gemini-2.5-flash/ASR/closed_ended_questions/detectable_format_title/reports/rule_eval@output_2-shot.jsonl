Therefore, my primary objective will be to provide a verbatim record of every word spoken in the audio. I'll focus on producing a high-fidelity transcription. I won't be inferring meaning or adding context; my role is to capture the spoken word as precisely as possible. I'll need to listen carefully, maybe even multiple times, to ensure that I capture every nuance, including hesitations, filler words (\"um,\" \"ah,\" etc.), and any unclear pronunciations that are present.
