This isn't just about getting the gist; it's about a high-fidelity rendering of the source material. I need to be sensitive to nuances of pronunciation, any background noise that might be impacting the intelligibility of the audio, or speech patterns, that are important for context. My goal is to produce a textual output that is, for all intents and purposes, a direct and faithful representation of the spoken content. I need to be prepared to account for any ambiguities in the audio, and make sure to clarify such ambiguities, to make the user fully aware. The more complex the audio, the more care is required.\n", "response": "we shut our eyes, the flowers bloom on. We murmur but the corn ears fill.
