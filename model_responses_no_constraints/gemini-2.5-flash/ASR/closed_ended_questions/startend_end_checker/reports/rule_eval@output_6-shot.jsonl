If any part of the audio is unclear, I’ll mark it as such and attempt to infer based on surrounding content, while erring on the side of caution. My output will be a clean, readable text document that accurately reflects the original audio.

This is straightforward enough; I'll approach this task meticulously. My primary focus is to achieve the highest possible fidelity. I'll need to listen attentively to the audio file. I'll focus on disambiguating the speech, considering any background noise, accents, or unclear articulation. I will endeavor to account for the context of any abbreviations or technical jargon, and, where possible, I may cross-reference the text with other documents. Any ambiguities or points of uncertainty will be carefully considered, and I will choose the transcription that I consider most accurate, but flag those points if necessary. I'll prioritize accuracy and completeness above all else, making sure that what's rendered reflects what was spoken.\n", "response": "however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end", "follow_instruction_list": [false], "follow_all_instructions": false, "strict_follow_instruction_list": [false], "strict_follow_all_instructions": false, "loose_follow_instruction_list": [false], "loose_follow_all_instructions": false, "response_for_scoring": "however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end", "wer": 0.0, "exact_match": true, "answer_correct": true}
