I\u2019ll make sure to account for any background noise or unclear pronunciation, and I'll make a note of it if I need to play the same audio section again.\n\nNext, the transcription phase. This is where precision takes over. I will take special care to type out *exactly* what I hear, including any instances of filler words (\"um,\" \"ah,\" etc.), hesitations, and even vocalizations that are relevant to understanding the intent of the speaker. It\u2019s about capturing the authentic delivery, not just the raw content. I may format it according to the parameters specified by the user, if applicable, to ensure their needs are met.\n\nOnce the transcription is complete, I'll do a quick review to double-check for errors, inconsistencies, or any details I may have missed during the initial listen. Accuracy is king, and a final check is always worth the time.
