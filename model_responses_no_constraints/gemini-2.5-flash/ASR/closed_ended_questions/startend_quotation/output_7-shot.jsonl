It seems the user wants a verbatim transcription of some audio. That's straightforward enough, though it *does* mean I have to be precise. My focus is going to be on accuracy. I'll need to listen to the audio very carefully, capturing every spoken word, pause, and any non-verbal sound that might be relevant or specifically requested (like background noise mentioned in the prompt). I need to make sure I don\u2019t gloss over anything. I'm aiming for a perfect word-for-word transcript, the kind that can be relied upon for analysis, reference, or whatever the user needs it for. So I\u2019ll proceed meticulously.\n", "response": "\"you were quite right to say no, Ambrose began, never smoke with Johnny Yago, his cigars will poison you.\""}
