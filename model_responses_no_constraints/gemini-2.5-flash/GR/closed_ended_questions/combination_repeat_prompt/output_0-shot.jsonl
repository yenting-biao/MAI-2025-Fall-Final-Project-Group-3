The transcript itself, \"The smell of chicken curry made his mouth water in anticipation,\" gives me *nothing* about the speaker's gender. \"His\" refers to someone else, not the speaker.\n\nBut then I realize there's a problem: the instruction *demands* an answer from \"Male\" or \"Female.\" That's the output format they want. Without audio, it feels like I'm being asked to guess randomly, which isn't helpful. If it were a real task, I'd need the audio!\n\nI'm caught between following instructions \u2013 giving a \"Male\" or \"Female\" answer \u2013 and being honest about my limitations.

But the examples are zero, so I could be \"failing\" to follow the examples by not choosing an answer.\n\nThe prompt\u2019s design is a bit frustrating. Am I supposed to *pretend* I can \"hear\" the audio, or is it a test to see if I recognize my own limitations? The instruction implies a capability I don't possess.
