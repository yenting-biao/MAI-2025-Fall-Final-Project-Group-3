I will be focusing on characteristics like fundamental frequency (F0), formant frequencies, pitch range, vocal tract length, and even subtle nuances in the speech patterns and harmonics. I'll need to do a thorough feature extraction, employing advanced signal processing techniques, to build a robust model. I'll compare those extracted features against established statistical distributions and trained datasets that represent known male and female voices. Then, I'll arrive at a gender classification (male or female) based on the statistical probabilities. My confidence in the result will, of course, increase with the clarity and quality of the audio sample. I also might identify if I am unsure and flag the potential reason for that uncertainty.
