I'll need to focus on fundamental frequency (F0), formant structure, and any characteristic vocal tract features that might be present. Specifically, I'll be paying close attention to:\n\n*   **F0 (Pitch):** A lower average F0, with a wider range, generally indicates a male voice, whereas a higher average with a narrower range suggests a female speaker. I know that the concept of pitch can be complicated by age and dialectal variations. I'll keep this in mind.\n*   **Formant Structure:** Female voices typically exhibit higher and more closely spaced formants due to their shorter vocal tracts. I will look for clues in the formant frequencies.\n*   **Vocal Tract Shape:** I am well aware that a smaller vocal tract will have a different sound than a larger one. Any resonance or other features related to vocal tract shape will be noticed.\n*   **Secondary Characteristics:** I'll also be considering any secondary characteristics, such as the voice's overall timbre, breathiness, and any potential noise elements which may or may not be relevant to my analysis. I am aware that such features can be caused by any number of things, and I will be listening for indicators.\n\nMy approach will be analytical, starting with a broad listen to get a sense of the overall vocal characteristics, followed by a more focused, spectral analysis if needed.
