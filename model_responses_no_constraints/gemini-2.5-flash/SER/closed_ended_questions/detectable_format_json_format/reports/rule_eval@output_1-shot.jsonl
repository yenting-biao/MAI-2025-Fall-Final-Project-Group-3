It's a quick assessment, choosing from a limited set of options: neutral, happy, sad, or angry. Fine.\n\nThe phrase itself is \"Oh, for real?\". Now, let's break down the vocal cues. The tone sounds excited, definitely with a rising inflection at the end, which really emphasizes the surprise. The pitch is noticeably higher than a normal speaking voice; this, combined with the rise, indicates heightened emotion. And the pace seems quick, another indication that the speaker is reacting in the moment.\n\nPutting it all together, the increased pitch, quick pace, and excited tone point directly to surprise and likely happiness or excitement.
