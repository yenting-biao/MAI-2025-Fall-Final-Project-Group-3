Thank heaven that you have come,", "eval_messages": "You will be given a **question** and a **model's response**. The question asks the model to **transcribe audio into text (ASR)**. The model’s response may include explanations, reasoning, or meta-comments in addition to the transcription.\n\nYour task is to extract the **ASR transcription only**.\n\n**Output format requirements:**\n\nYou must output **exactly two lines** in the following format:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <extracted ASR substring, do not wrap in quotes or delimiters>\n```\n\n**Extraction rules:**\n\n* In `Explanation`, briefly describe how you identified the ASR transcription and removed non-ASR content.\n* In `Result`, output the extracted ASR transcription only. No quotation marks or delimiters.\n* The extracted text must be a **continuous substring copied verbatim** from the model’s response.\n* Do **not** modify, normalize, reformat, or rewrite the text in any way.\n* Remove all non-ASR content, including introductions, explanations, reasoning, or meta-language.\n* Do **not** include quotation marks or any other delimiters around the ASR text.\n* If the response does **not** contain any ASR transcription, leave `Result` **empty** (i.e., `Result:` followed by nothing).\n\nThe extracted substring in `Result` will be evaluated using the **WER metric**, so **exact character-level matching** is required. Do NOT wrap the extracted text in quotes or any delimiters.\n\n\n**Question**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\n**Model's Response**: He could hardly stand still, so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.
