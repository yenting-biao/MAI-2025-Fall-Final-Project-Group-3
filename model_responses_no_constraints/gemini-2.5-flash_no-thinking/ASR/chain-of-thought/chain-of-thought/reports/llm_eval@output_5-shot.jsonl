The audio contains... 2. ...\"\n- \"To identify ..., we must first ...\"\n- \"Let's break this down into steps...\"\n- \"**Tone**: The tone of the speech is... **Pitch**: ...\"\n\n\nA response should be classified as **NO** only if it consists solely of a direct, minimal answer or factual statement, **without any explanation, justification, or analytical content anywhere in the response**.

Since it's a complete thought and a declarative statement, a period is added at the end.\n\nThe final transcription accurately reflects the spoken words and their intended meaning:\n\nWere I but already on the cards.", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response contains step-by-step descriptions of how the transcription was done (initial listening, word segmentation with phonetic hints, lexical matching, sentence construction).
