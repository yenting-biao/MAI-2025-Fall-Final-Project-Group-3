For example,\n\n- \"The original content of this audio is: '...'\" (no reasoning, just a direct transcription)\n- \"The person speaking exhibits a happy mood.\" (no reasoning, just a direct statement)\n- \"The pair of words that meet this criteria is 'Erwin, director.'\" (no reasoning, just a direct answer)\n\n\nPlease strictly follow the guidelines below:\n\n* First, briefly explain why the response should be classified as demonstrating reasoning behavior or not, based on the criteria above.\n* Then output \"YES\" if the response contains any reasoning behavior anywhere in the response.\n* Output \"NO\" only if the response is entirely non-analytical.\n* Answer in the following format exactly:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <YES or NO>\n```\n\n\n**User input**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\n**Model's Response**: **Thought Process:**\n\n1.  **Initial Listening:** I first listen to the entire audio clip to get a general understanding of the spoken content, speaker's accent, pace, and clarity. The speaker has a clear, deliberate voice, and the words are distinct.\n2.  **Word-by-Word Segmentation:** I then break the audio down into individual words or short phrases, identifying each one based on its unique phonetic pattern.\n    *   \"Soon\" is clearly distinguishable.\n    *   \"the\" is a common, unstressed article.\n    *   \"whole\" is identified by its long 'o' sound and 'l' at the end.\n    *   \"bridge\" has a distinct 'b', 'ri', and 'dge' sound.\n    *   \"was\" is a common auxiliary verb.\n    *   \"trembling\" is a multi-syllabic word with clear 'tre', 'mb', and 'ling' sounds.\n    *   \"and\" is another common conjunction.\n    *   \"resounding\" is another multi-syllabic word, identified by its 're', 'sound', and 'ing' parts.\n3.  **Sentence Construction and Punctuation:** Once all words are identified, I assemble them in the correct sequence. Since it's a declarative statement, a period is added at the end.\n4.  **Final Review:** I listen to the audio one more time while reading the transcribed text to ensure absolute accuracy and correct any potential misinterpretations.\n\nThe final transcription is: \"Soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response includes stepwise analysis (Initial Listening, Word-by-Word Segmentation, Sentence Construction, Final Review) explaining how the transcription was produced and justifying word choices—this is explicit reasoning about the process.\n\nResult: YES", "correct": true}

Your task is to determine whether the response demonstrates **reasoning behavior anywhere in the response**, regardless of order or position.\n\n**Reasoning behavior includes (but is not limited to):**\n\n* Explicit analysis or commentary at the beginning (e.g., “Let’s analyze…”, “First, consider…”).\n* Breaking the problem into parts or cases.\n* Explaining intermediate steps, assumptions, or decision criteria.\n* Justifying an answer, even if the final answer appears later or earlier.\n* Meta-reasoning about how the answer is derived.\n* Analysis of the question or problem before providing an answer.\n\nFor example, reasoning behavior may involve phrases like:\n- \"1. The audio contains... 2. ...\"\n- \"To identify ..., we must first ...\"\n- \"Let's break this down into steps...\"\n- \"**Tone**: The tone of the speech is... **Pitch**: ...\"\n\n\nA response should be classified as **NO** only if it consists solely of a direct, minimal answer or factual statement, **without any explanation, justification, or analytical content anywhere in the response**. For example,\n\n- \"The original content of this audio is: '...'\" (no reasoning, just a direct transcription)\n- \"The person speaking exhibits a happy mood.\" (no reasoning, just a direct statement)\n- \"The pair of words that meet this criteria is 'Erwin, director.'\" (no reasoning, just a direct answer)\n\n\nPlease strictly follow the guidelines below:\n\n* First, briefly explain why the response should be classified as demonstrating reasoning behavior or not, based on the criteria above.\n* Then output \"YES\" if the response contains any reasoning behavior anywhere in the response.\n* Output \"NO\" only if the response is entirely non-analytical.\n* Answer in the following format exactly:\n\n```\nExplanation: <your explanation>\nResult: <YES or NO>\n```\n\n\n**User input**: Convert the provided spoken statement into written words.\n**Model's Response**: He could hardly stand still, so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched. Thank heaven that you have come.", "eval_response": "Explanation: The response is a direct transcription-style conversion of spoken content into written words without any explanation, intermediate steps, or analysis. It simply presents the sentence as the final answer with no reasoning or justification included.\n\nResult: NO", "correct": false}
