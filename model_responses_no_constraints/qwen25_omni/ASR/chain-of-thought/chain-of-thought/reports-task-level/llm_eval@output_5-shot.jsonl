A language model evaluates the sequence \"Were I but already on the cards\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"Were I but already on the cards.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I identified the model's final transcribed sentence in the response and removed all preceding explanatory and meta-content.

The sentence structure is grammatically correct and coherent.\n5. **Final Verification:** The constructed sentence is reviewed to ensure it accurately reflects the spoken content. The transcription is confirmed to be accurate.\n\n**Final Transcription:**\n\n\"Unfortunately the fracture cannot be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.\"", "eval_response": "Explanation: I located the model's final transcription sentence within the response and removed all explanatory and meta-content, keeping only the quoted transcription text verbatim and without the surrounding quotes.\n\nResult: Unfortunately the fracture cannot be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at her house in a very doubtful and dangerous state.", "correct": 0.07894736842105263}
