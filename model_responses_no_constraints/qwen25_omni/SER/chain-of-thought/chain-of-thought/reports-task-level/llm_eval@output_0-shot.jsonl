What do you think the speaker's emotion is?", "eval_response": "Explanation: The model's response does not give one of the required four emotion labels (neutral, happy, sad, angry). Instead it hedges, describes possibilities, and asks a follow-up question. This fails to match the ground truth answer \"happy\" and does not provide a definitive label as requested.\n\nResult: NO", "correct": false}
