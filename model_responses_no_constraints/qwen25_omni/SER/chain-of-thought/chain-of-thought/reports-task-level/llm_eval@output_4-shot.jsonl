This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"audio\", \"audio_url\": \"./in-context-examples/audios/general/1.wav\"}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Determine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice.

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly.

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"audio\", \"audio_url\": \"./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_impro07_M001.wav\"}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Pay close attention to the tone, pitch, and pace of the voice, as well as any pauses or emphasis, to infer the underlying emotion expressed in the spoken utterance.
