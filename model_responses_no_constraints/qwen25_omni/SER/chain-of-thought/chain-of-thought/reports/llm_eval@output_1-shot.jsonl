Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion.
