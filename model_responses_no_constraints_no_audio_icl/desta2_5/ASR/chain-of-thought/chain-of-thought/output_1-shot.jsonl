A language model evaluates the sequence \"He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come\" as a grammatically correct and highly probable phrase in English. A period is added at the end to signify the completion of a declarative statement.\n\nThe final transcribed sentence is: \"He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come.\""}
