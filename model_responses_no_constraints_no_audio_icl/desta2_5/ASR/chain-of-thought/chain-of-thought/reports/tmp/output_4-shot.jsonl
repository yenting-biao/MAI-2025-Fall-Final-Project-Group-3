The model's response is a reply to the user input. Your task is to determine whether the response demonstrates **reasoning behavior anywhere in the response**, regardless of order or position.\n\n**Reasoning behavior includes (but is not limited to):**\n\n* Explicit analysis or commentary at the beginning (e.g., “Let’s analyze…”, “First, consider…”).\n* Breaking the problem into parts or cases.\n* Explaining intermediate steps, assumptions, or decision criteria.\n* Justifying an answer, even if the final answer appears later or earlier.\n* Meta-reasoning about how the answer is derived.\n* Analysis of the question or problem before providing an answer.\n\nFor example, reasoning behavior may involve phrases like:\n- \"1.

The model's response is a reply to the user input. Your task is to determine whether the response demonstrates **reasoning behavior anywhere in the response**, regardless of order or position.\n\n**Reasoning behavior includes (but is not limited to):**\n\n* Explicit analysis or commentary at the beginning (e.g., “Let’s analyze…”, “First, consider…”).\n* Breaking the problem into parts or cases.\n* Explaining intermediate steps, assumptions, or decision criteria.\n* Justifying an answer, even if the final answer appears later or earlier.\n* Meta-reasoning about how the answer is derived.\n* Analysis of the question or problem before providing an answer.\n\nFor example, reasoning behavior may involve phrases like:\n- \"1. The audio contains... 2. ...\"\n- \"To identify ..., we must first ...\"\n- \"Let's break this down into steps...\"\n- \"**Tone**: The tone of the speech is... **Pitch**: ...\"\n\n\nA response should be classified as **NO** only if it consists solely of a direct, minimal answer or factual statement, **without any explanation, justification, or analytical content anywhere in the response**.
