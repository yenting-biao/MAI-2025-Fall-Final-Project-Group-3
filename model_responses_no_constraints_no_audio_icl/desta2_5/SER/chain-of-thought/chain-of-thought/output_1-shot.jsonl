Here's my assessment:\n\n**Tone:** The speaker's tone is warm and inviting, with a hint of excitement. The voice has a gentle, soothing quality to it, which suggests a positive emotional state.\n\n**Pitch:** The pitch is moderate, with a slight upward inflection at the end of the sentence. This rising pitch indicates a sense of enthusiasm and eagerness.\n\n**Pace:** The speaker's pace is moderate, with a slight pause between words and a gentle rhythm. This suggests a relaxed and conversational tone.\n\n**Volume:** The volume is consistent, with no sudden increases or decreases. This suggests that the speaker is not trying to emphasize or convey strong emotions.\n\n**Expressive variations:** The speaker's voice has a few expressive variations, such as a slight pause before the final word, which adds a sense of drama and emphasis. The tone also has a slight \"smile\" in it, which is conveyed through the warmth and friendliness of the voice.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on these factors, I would categorize the speaker's emotional state as **happy**.
