There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"audio\", \"audio_url\": \"./data/audios/Speech_emotion_recognition/Ses05M_impro07_M001.wav\"}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Pay close attention to the tone, pitch, and pace of the voice, as well as any pauses or emphasis, to infer the underlying emotion expressed in the spoken utterance.
