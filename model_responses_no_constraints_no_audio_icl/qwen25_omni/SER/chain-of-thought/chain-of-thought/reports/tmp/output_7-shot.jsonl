There is a distinct downward inflection at the end, where the voice falls off, rather than rising or staying level. This lack of pitch variation and downward movement suggests low energy.\\n\\n**Step 2: Tone Analysis**\\nThe tone of the voice is subdued and lacks brightness or resonance. It sounds heavy and slightly weary, without the crispness of a neutral or happy state, or the tension of an angry one.\\n\\n**Step 3: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a slow, deliberate pace. The words are drawn out slightly, contributing to a feeling of low energy and lethargy. The rhythm is not hurried or clipped.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nThe combination of a low and falling pitch, a heavy tone, and a slow pace are all indicators of a low-arousal, negative emotional state.\\n\\nSad\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Examine the tonal quality, pacing, and pitch of the voice, as well as contextual cues, to identify the speaker’s emotion.

There is a noticeable tension in the tone, which lacks any warmth or gentleness. This harshness suggests a strong, high-arousal emotional state.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Pacing Analysis**\\nThe speech is delivered at a deliberate, almost clipped pace. Each word is enunciated with significant force and separation, rather than flowing together in a conversational manner. This emphatic and punctuated delivery style indicates that the speaker is making a firm demand, not a casual request.\\n\\n**Phase 3: Pitch Analysis**\\nThe pitch of the voice is elevated and maintains a high level of intensity throughout the short sentence. It does not have the melodic, rising and falling intonation typical of neutral or happy speech. Instead, the sustained high pitch contributes to the overall intensity and force of the utterance.\\n\\n**Phase 4: Synthesis of Cues**\\nWhile the words themselves (\\\"I would like a new alarm clock\\\") could form a neutral request, the acoustic cues tell a different story. The combination of a loud, strained tone, forceful and deliberate pacing, and a high, intense pitch points to a powerful negative emotion. The speaker is clearly agitated and is expressing extreme frustration or making a non-negotiable demand. This emotional expression is far from neutral, happy, or sad.\\n\\nAngry\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Determine the emotional category by listening for patterns of stress, tone, and pace in the voice.

There is a sharp, percussive stress placed on \\\"eleven\\\" and \\\"o'clock,\\\" making the statement sound like an exclamation or an accusation rather than a simple declaration of time.\\n*   **Tone:** The pitch of the voice is high and sounds strained. This strained quality is inconsistent with a neutral, happy, or sad emotional state. It suggests significant tension and frustration.\\n*   **Pace:** The phrase is delivered very quickly and abruptly. This rapid pace indicates a high state of emotional arousal, ruling out emotions typically associated with a slower pace, such as sadness or neutrality.\\n\\nThe combination of a fast pace, a high and strained tone, and forceful stress points to a high-arousal, negative emotion.\\n\\nAngry\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Focus on how the speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm shift throughout the utterance to infer the emotion behind their words.

It lacks the strained quality of anger or the subdued, heavy quality of sadness. Instead, the tone is warm and gentle, conveying a sense of care and pleasantness.\\n\\n*   **Rhythm:** The pace of the speech is natural and even, with a smooth, almost melodic rhythm. This flowing cadence contributes to the overall cheerful and positive feeling of the utterance, contrasting with the clipped, sharp rhythm of anger or the slow, drawn-out pace of sadness.\\n\\nCombining these observations, the bright tone, melodic rhythm, and rising pitch all strongly indicate a positive emotional state.\\n\\nHappy\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Identify emotion by detecting patterns in tone, pitch modulation, and pacing variation.

There is no discernible emotional charge, such as warmth, excitement, or agitation.

There are no significant upward or downward shifts that would indicate strong feelings. The vocal range used is narrow and falls within a moderate, conversational level.\\n\\n*   **Pacing Variation Analysis**: The pace of speech is moderate and consistent. The words are spoken at a normal, conversational speed, without being rushed or slowed down. The rhythm is steady, lacking the sharp, abrupt quality of anger or the lethargic flow of sadness.\\n\\n*   **Synthesis of Observations**: The combination of an even tone, stable pitch, and moderate pacing suggests that the speaker is conveying information without emotional involvement.

The even rhythm of the speech points to a composed state.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analysis of Vocal Strength**\\nThe volume of the speaker's voice is at a normal, conversational level. There is no evidence of shouting, which would be associated with anger, or a weak, quiet voice, which could be linked to sadness. The vocal strength is consistent and clear.\\n\\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Observations**\\nThe combination of a flat tone, a moderate speech rate, and a normal vocal strength indicates a lack of strong emotional expression.
